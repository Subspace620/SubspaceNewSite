<p>December 13 2005</p>
<p>Heroes In Attendance: </p>
<p>Odana-Urr <br>
Pashira <br>
Nichos <br>
Mushu <br>
Zarrix <br>
Sora <br>
And our newest Heroes Widdimur and Keychu </p>
<p>At the start of the session, this was the recap 
of the previous session: </p>
<p>&quot;When we last left our heroes, they had received 
their first assignment as the newest members of the Mercenary Guild on Rov Dar 
VII. They are proceeding to the spaceport to rent a starship for their use.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the open of the session, the heroes 
received the following briefing: <br>
&nbsp;Zeraphros “Okay, folks, here’s the deal. We’ve 
got the last known coordinates for the convoy from an Imperial scout ship; 
they’re traveling along the&nbsp; &nbsp; Hydian Way at light speed, but you should be able 
to intercept them before they drop out at their destination. We know there’s 3 
ships, but we don’t know how much they’re carrying; all the Empire knows is that 
they’re in an awful hurry to get where they’re going.The scans that they did get 
caused them to randomly change course, so make sure you use passive sensors.&nbsp; 
You get half your fee now, and half upon return. Oh, and just one more thing…as 
a token of ‘good faith’ I need you folks to bring back an item with the Rebel 
logo on it, just to make sure you’re not just ‘putting on a show.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heroes proceeded to the Rov Dar 
Spaceport to do a deal with Moryx Vingent, who had only one ship available for 
rent, the &quot;Venture Forge&quot;. As they were waiting for Vingent to arrive, several 
Heroes heard a scratching noise next to the ship. Firing up their glow rods, 
they investigated to find a tiny rabbit-like Kushiban ((AAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! :) )) 
and another small Menahu trying to get into the ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After mutual threats from both sides, and 
a quick explanation by the quick-witted Kushiban, Widdimur, it was determined 
that he and his companion Keychu were simply trying to get off planet; how they 
got on planet in the first place is still a mystery, but it's likely they'll 
tell their story on some future hyperspace trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon boarding the ship, getting settled, 
and going through the pre-flights, the &quot;Venture Forge&quot; lifted off from Docking 
Bay 76 and set a course for Ploo. Enroot, our Heroes rested in the lounge and 
their staterooms. With all settled and rested, Nichos put the ship on autopilot, 
and the Heroes planned their battle strategy:</p>
<p>-The information they got from the Guild stated 
three ships in the convoy, the transports most likely being lightly-armed 
Gallofree Yards Medium Transports. -All agreed that the escort should be the 
primary target upon dropping from hyperspace <br>
-It was determined that Sora and Widdimur would 
operate the ship's two ion cannons; if they could disable but not destroy the 
transports, the cargo might be salvaged along with the ships.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
-The battle plan was laid out as follows: the &quot;Venture Forge&quot; would drop from 
hyperspace, with Nichos at the helm, Mushu on sensors, Pashira on weapons, and 
Sora and Widdimur (with Keychu) operating the ion cannons; the rest would be 
ready for boarding actions. Primary target would be the escort; once it was out 
of the way, they were free to go after the freighters. Depending on the cargo, 
the heroes all agreed on 'salvaging' what they found. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their plan in place, the Heroes dropped 
from hyperspace in the Ploo system, staying long enough to determine that the 
convoy left within the past six hours. Plotting a course along their last known 
trajectory (towards the Toprawa Sector), the &quot;Venture Forge&quot; and her valiant 
crew closed quickly on the convoy, as the freighters could only travel as fast 
as the transports, which had slow hyperdrives. Staying several light-minutes 
behind, the crew initiated intensive scans, knowing that this would cause the 
convoy to drop to realspace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As expected, they did, and the battle was 
on; the &quot;Venture Forge&quot; dropping to realspace only a few kilometers away. 
Suspecting our Heroes to be pirates, the escort cruiser, a Corellian Corvette, 
began to engage as the transports moved towards the hyperspace jump point. 
Several well-placed shots by those on the ion cannons and weapons took the 
cruiser out quickly, leaving it dead in space. Being more tactful with the 
freighters (to keep the cargoes intact), they succeeded in jamming one 
transport's navicomputer (so it couldn't go to hyperspace) and damaged the 
other. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Docking with the first transport, the 
boarding party raided the transport, but they encountered some resistance; six 
Rebel guards intent on not letting them get the ship's cargo. In the mayhem that 
ensued, our Heroes came out on top; killing several Rebel guards and taking 
prisoners, who were promptly locked up in the brig. After boarding the second 
ship and getting its cargo manifest, the crew determined that they were dealing 
with several million credits' worth of merchandise. Keeping their 'fair share' 
and devoting a cut to the Guild, they sold the rest and are enroute back to Rov 
Dar VII, with a very comfortable float in their bank account.</p>
<p>GM's Notes: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :) You guys took me completely by 
surprise…I expected a much different outcome…I'll have to come up with a bit of 
a tougher scenario for next time.</p>
