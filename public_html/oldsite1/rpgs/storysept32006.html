<p>Sept 3 2006, a recap of the past two adventures. </p>
<p>Our Heroes, looking for yet another   profitable mission, entered the Guild Hall and saw a choice of three missions:   one to Tatooine for an unknown benefactor, a research mission for an Arkanian   scientist, and a delivery mission to a rough sector of space. Choosing the   (seemingly profitable) mission to Tatooine, the Heroes boarded their ship and   ventured to the distant Outer Rim, and the desert planet known as Tatooine.   After &lsquo;negotiating&rsquo; with the dock master in Mos Eisley, the crew is permitted to   land in the &lsquo;wretched hive of scum and villainy&rsquo;. They are sitting in the   cantina while their cargo is loaded when they are approached by a greasy-looking   human by the name of Haarbo Wiis. He has mistakenly delivered them a cargo   intended for another group of recipients, and now fears the worst and shows   little concern for our unwary Heroes. </p>
<p>Finishing their drinks and   negotiating around several bar fights, the group returned to their ship in time   to find some thugs planting an explosive on their cargo door. They&rsquo;re too late   to stop the explosion, but not for the ensuing fight. As our heroes are   distracted by the thugs the gang leader, one Oggun Bantha-horn, shows up to make   sure his people are doing their jobs. The thugs are fought off, but not after   doing damage to the Heroes&rsquo; ship. All this fuss has drawn the attention of the   local Stormtrooper regiment; the Heroes decide to execute the better part of   valour and fire up their engines, heading out west over the Dune Sea to the   Jundland Wastes. It&rsquo;s not long after they leave Mos Eisley than they&rsquo;re attacked   by a group of Incom T-36 Skyfighters (which they don&rsquo;t know belong to Haarbo   Wiis&rsquo;s employer). Two of the Skyfighters are shot down. As Nichos manoeuvres the   ship carefully because of the large hole in the hull, the other Heroes man the   guns and keep the engines running until&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;A sand whirl appears on the   horizon. The <em>Venture Forge </em>is   grounded, but not without taking the remaining Skyfighters to the ground with   it. The <em>Venture Forge </em>is buried   in the sand, not deeply but deep enough that the Heroes can&rsquo;t access their   Y-wings or the cargo bay. The intake manifolds are clogged deeply with sand, so   Zarix and the R2 units begin to unclog the intakes and make repairs when the   rumbling tremors of a Sandcrawler catch the crew&rsquo;s attention. The Jawas in this   sandcrawler, led by Empideera Kkek, are looking to acquire the Heroes&rsquo; ship for   scrap metal and attempt to claim it as their property. Some expert diplomacy by   Pashira and Odana-Urr gets them off the hook, but the Jawas are startled by   sounds only they can hear and scramble back to the   sandcrawler.</p>
<p>The Heroes don&rsquo;t have to wait long   to find out what startled the Jawas as a blood-curdling war cry is heard from   just over the next dune. A group of Tusken Raiders, more commonly known as   Sandpeople, has attacked the Heroes and the Jawas. With Mushu on the ship&rsquo;s guns   and the rest of the crew fighting hand to hand, the Tuskens are quickly   dispatched. The crew goes back to the business of dealing with the Jawas and   repairs when they hear a scraping sound coming over the dune. This is A-Zulman,   the leader of the Tusken tribe that has just attacked (and been killed by) the   Heroes. He is badly wounded with a splint on his leg; his resolve is nothing   short of amazing, as Tuskens who are too weak to survive in the desert are left   for dead by their tribes. </p>
<p>A-Zulman is distrusting of   outsiders, the Jawas especially, and so reluctantly accepts help from the   Heroes. Empideera&rsquo;s translator/power droid informs the Heroes that A-Zulman&rsquo;s   tribe was defeated by something the wounded Tusken only refers to as &ldquo;very large   sand&rdquo;. Intrigued and disturbed, the Heroes realize that the Tusken&rsquo;s banthas can   aid in pulling out the ship; they also realize that they will need water if they   have to go back to Mos Eisley for help. So, Zarix and Nichos opt to stay behind   with the ship while the rest board the banthas along with A-Zulman to retrieve   some water. </p>
<p>Upon reaching the cave where the   Tuskens draw water, they find a large starship that has crashed. When the Heroes   want to investigate, A-Zulman adamantly refuses and stays behind with the   banthas. As the heroes near the cave, they hear a low soft crunching noise under   the sand and right in front of them rises the giant Mole Serpent, which is   undoubtedly the creature referred to as &lsquo;extremely large sand&rsquo; by A-Zulman. The   Mole Serpent attacks the heroes; in the ensuing battle, Odana is gravely injured   and sits out the rest of the fight. As they Heroes fight for their lives, they   are visited by Rannon Djelkh and his cronies riding cargo skiffs. Djelkh taunts   the heroes with the Mole Serpent toxin (the only thing he claims can kill it),   but is himself set up by a disgruntled colleague. The <em>Venture Forge </em>arrives, but she&rsquo;s barely   flying at the moment. The ship&rsquo;s guns easily take care of the Mole Serpent, and   the Heroes dispatch Rannon Djelkh; using the cargo skiffs the haul away the   wreckage and open the cave for A-Zulman. Taking some of the scrap from the   wreckage to repair their ship, the Heroes limp back to the outskirts of Mos   Eisley.</p>
<p>When repairs are completed, the ship   lifts off and notices that there are now two Imperial Star Destroyers in orbit   of Tatooine, and that the Imperial presence on the planet is increasing. As the   Heroes leave the Tatooine system, they investigate the cargo they were hired to   pick up. It is a load of proton torpedoes, and upon closer inspection each   torpedo contains a subspace tracking device insidiously crafted into the logo&hellip;of   Vortex.</p>
<p>With Pashira vowing revenge, the   crew decides to reconfigure the tracking devices before making delivery. As the   crew makes way back to Rov-Dar VII, their subspace relay picks up a message from   the Alliance to Restore the Republic: it is a video image of the remains of the   Alderaan system, destroyed by the Empire&rsquo;s new super weapon the Death   Star.</p>
<p>Sora, being from Alderaan and   possessing ability unknown to the others, feels a great and unexplainable sense   of pain and loss as this communiqu&eacute; comes in. She locks herself in her quarters   and doesn&rsquo;t come out until they return to home base.</p>
<p align="center">=================================================================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<DIV id="ygrp-text">
  <DIV>
	<p>Upon returning to Rov-Dar, Sora is   still in her quarters and Keychu and Widdimur continue to guard the base. The   Heroes go to the Guild Hall to collect their fee, only to find that the   Guildmaster is being confronted by Stormtroopers. The Guildmaster is adamant   that the Rov-Dar Mercenary Guild is a neutral party and has no connections to   the Rebel Alliance or the Empire. When the Stormtroopers leave, the Guildmaster   informs the Heroes that the Empire is no longer welcome to post job offers at   the Guild, as he&rsquo;s from Alderaan and his wife was killed in the attack. The   Guildmaster has no love for the Empire any longer.</p>
	<p>The crew decides that a much-needed   break is in order while Pashira and company deliver their cargo to Vortex   (uneventfully) . When everyone meets up back in the marketplace, they find that   the Stormptroopers are enforcing the Emperor&rsquo;s New Order with gusto; they are   arresting or severely taxing any alien merchants, legitimate or otherwise, for   no reason other than the fact that they aren&rsquo;t human. Keeping out of the way as   much as possible, the Heroes go about their shopping.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-Pashira has purchased a number of   new droids for the collection, including a binary load lifter.</p>
	<p>-Zarix purchased a few interesting   trinkets for himself</p>
	<p>-The rest of the crew purchased   items that they needed or wanted (memory is sketchy on the actual   items).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>When they returned to base, Pashira   received an urgent communiqu&eacute; from a friend of hers, and immediately set out for   Farghul. The rest of the crew decided that they&rsquo;d take the time to train and   rest up before everyone set out on the next big adventure.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>And so, everyone has been spending   the last three weeks (game time) on various adventures. The traveling groups   are:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-Zarrix is travelling with   Odana-Urr; Odana is headed to Coruscant to protest the treatment of aliens. Will   he meet with resistance himself? Zarrix is searching for his lost home world;   will he find the coordinates, or just more clues?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-Sora is travelling alone; she has   decided to travel to the remains of the Alderaan system in the hopes of making   peace&hellip;or fuelling revenge?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-Mushu is travelling alone; what   kind of adventures and mischief will she get up to?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-Nichos is called away on business;   he didn&rsquo;t say where he was going, but he took one of the Y-wings and headed   off.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-Keychu and Widdimur are traveling   together; what will they get up to?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-Pashira is headed to Farghul; what   urgent business awaits her there?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Until next   time&hellip;</p>
