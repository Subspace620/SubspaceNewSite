<p align="left">The SubSpace 620 Science 
Fiction Club is all about fun and fellowship. It's not easy being a sci-fi fan 
without getting a few weird looks from people...even if your not wearing a 
costume let alone own a costume. WE ARE a social club for people who like this 
genre of writing, though TV, Books, Movies, Radio, or Games. WE STRIVE to make 
the best of our University Years by having fun, and know that inside everyone 
who snubs us and every time we get bashed by some character in the Gateway, we 
know that inside those people a little bit of love for the genre is trying to 
get out.</p>

<p align="left">The Club itself is at least 
19 years old, having begun by 1990-91 at the latest. We would love for former 
members of the club at that time to make contact with us so that we can learn 
how old the club is. This is very important to us as history seems to say 
84-85...hmmm that's 25 years old this year!!!! If you have any info on how 
old the club is contact us: <a href="mailto:subspace@ualberta.ca?subject=AGE OF CLUB via SITE">on 
our hailing frequency</a>.  
We'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p align="left">The Club itself is a member 
run club. The Executive is only here to facilitate and run/make sure the events 
are legal and take place. It is up to the members at large to say what they want 
to do. </p>
