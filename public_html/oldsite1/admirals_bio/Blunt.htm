Assimilated into the Star Trek Universe, due to parental units, not much
is known about her. Just transferred from the U.S.S. McGill. Likes to haggle
with Ferengi and that she has frequent flyer mileage to Sickbay (You name
it, she's broken it, bruised it, sprained it, torn it and pulled it) and
is proud of it. Was promoted to Lt. Commander Jody's position after Commander Jo asked for a demotion
and Jody became Vice- President.
<p>Captain Blunt commanded SubSpace for 4 years before getting her own support 
ship the USS Costanza NCC-200304. Which she valiantly commanded for 2 more years 
before being promoted to Admiral in April 2005.</p>
<p>The reasons for the promotion depend on who you ask. Starfleet states that it 
was due to her exlempary service, while the crew claims that it was to to 
preserve their sanity from not only her 'pythonisms', but to keep her from doing 
more damage to the computer systems. She is still around but only in an advisory 
role. Her future plans include converting many youngsters to Pythonism.</p>
