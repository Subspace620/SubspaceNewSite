<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">The Federation was handed a bitter pill to
swallow recently, when Admiral Malmot, one of Starfleet's most distinguished
officers, announced that he was actually a RomuLam double agent. The announcement
put to rest the long months of specualtion concerning the supposedly Vulcan's
mysterious disappearance during a routine survey mission on Hrconus III.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Malmot, now a praetor of the Star Empire,
served a long, fruitful career in Starfleet, including full tours of duty
as second officer aboard the <I>U.S.S. Incontinent</I>, and as the captain
of the <I>U.S.S. Inconceivable</I>. The RomuLam agent occasionally appears
in the Sol Univas B system to harass<a href="r_leddy.htm"> Captain
Robert Leddy</a> and the crew of SubSpace 6-20. Captain Leddy believes
these visitations underlie Malmot's resentment toward the station commander.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">"It was pretty clear from the start that
he couldn't tolerate taking orders from someone with no experience as a
starship captain," commented Leddy, on the <I>Inconceivable</I>'s reassignment
to SubSpace 6-20. When asked about the repeated appearances of Malmot's
ship, the Warbird <I>Peregrine</I>, Leddy speculated that "he probably
does it just to play mind games with our command staff.</FONT>
