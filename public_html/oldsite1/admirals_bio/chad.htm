<font face="arial,helvetica">Originally discovered on stardate 3141.9 Commander
Chadwick was among the survivors of a "sleeper ship" called the Botany
Bay from the late twentieth century discovered by the U.S.S. Enterprise.
After a failed attempt to take control of the Enterprise with his leader
(and rumoured half brother) Khan Noonian Singh. Chadwick and his genetically
engineered superior intellect&nbsp; was among Khan's crew of the Botany
Bay exiled to Ceti Alpha V. During his years of exile on the once lush
but now barren wasteland that is Ceti Alpha V, Chadwick realized the error
of Khan's tyrannical rule and bided his time. Once Khan took control of
the U.S.S Reliant, Chadwick saw this was his chance to escape, and daringly
escaped in shuttlecraft moments before the ship entered the Mutara Nebula
pursuing the Enterprise. (The nebula rendered the Reliants sensors useless,
hence his escape went undetected for you "anal about detail" types out
there). Some time later the shuttlecraft ran out of energy and Chadwick
used his genetically engineered superior intellect to place himself in
a state of suspended animation in the hopes he would one day be found.</font>
<br><font face="arial,helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drifting aimlessly
for five years, his shuttlecraft was picked up by the U.S.S Diuretic who
dropped him off on Planet SLAVE ON FOODS. For five long years Chadwick
and his genetically engineered superior intellect&nbsp; toiled in the salt
mines of Planet SLAVE ON FOODS. Surviving power mad crew chiefs, little
pay, snotty cashiers, and terrible shifts, Chadwick and his genetically
engineered superior intellect&nbsp; saved enough gold pressed latinum to
buy transport to earth where he joined Starfleet. His genetically engineered
superior intellect allowed Chadwick to graduate Starfleet with distinction.
His handling of the Kobayashi Maru scenario was unorthodox but had the
distinction of never been done before. (He photon torpedoed the bejeezus
out of the Kobayashi Maru, "Why the (expletive deleted) is the Kobayashi
Maru in the neutral zone in the first place?" he arrogantly demanded,&nbsp;
and used his transporters to beam every piece of underwear he owned, both
pairs, to the Klingon ships and he high tailed it out of the neutral zone.
Upon graduating Starfleet Chadwick was assigned for a one year stint aboard
the U.S.S. Grant MacKewan. Transferred in the fall of last year to Subspace
620 Chadwick was not involved in club activities as he would have liked
to have been last year. Rumour has it his lack of involvement was because
he was assigned to Tribble cleanup after he consumed too much Roumulan
ale at a Starfleet function and called Captain Picard "...a bald pansy..",
called Captain Janeway "... a bootylicious hot mama ..." and&nbsp; told
Captain Kirk that "...he fights really well for a fat guy in a toupee...".
Returning this year and using his genetically engineered superior intellect&nbsp;
to quickly rise in the ranks from ensign to commander, Commander Chadwick
Noonian Singh Mitchell pledges that this year he will find his Vulcan katra
and "destroy with an iron fist all those who oppose his righteous rule
and crush beneath him they who deny his genetically engineered superior
intellect" ....er....ummm....he means have lots of fun this year...yeah...yeah
that's it. Did he mention that he possesses genetically engineered superior
intellect?.&nbsp;</font><!--Test html file-->
