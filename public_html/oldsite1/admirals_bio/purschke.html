<DIV>
  <p><strong>Favourite</strong> <strong>Canadian Town/City</strong>: Umm&hellip;Okotoks?   NO! WAIT! I know this one! Wait for it&hellip;wait for it&hellip;keepwaiting&hellip;honest I know   this&hellip;let&rsquo;s just stick with Okotoks, that way I don&rsquo;t have to think of anywhere   else.</p>
</DIV>
<DIV>
  <p><strong>Why</strong>: It&rsquo;s kind of a funny sounding   word&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
</DIV>
<DIV>
  <p><strong>Favourite   World City:</strong> That would be   Puerto Vallarta&nbsp;</p>
</DIV>
<DIV>
  <p><strong>Favourite   Composer</strong>: hmmm&hellip;.what was   the question again?&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Favourite   Artist</strong>: Bon Jovi (I don&rsquo;t   want to hear the snickers, just accept it and move on)&nbsp;</p>
</DIV>
<DIV>
  <p><strong>Favourite   Flower</strong>: those are those   floppy smelly plant-like things, right? I like the silk ones that you don&rsquo;t have   to water.&nbsp;</p>
</DIV>

<DIV>
  <p><strong>Dog or Cat   Person?:</strong> Do I have to   live with it? Because I won&rsquo;t live with it. If I don&rsquo;t have to live with it I   prefer cats. But I&rsquo;m not living with it.</p>

  <p><strong>Favourite   Star Wars Movie</strong>: Ooh&hellip;I   must admit, the only one I actually <strong><em>own</em></strong> is Return of the Jedi. I   like the Ewoks&hellip;they&rsquo;re fuzzy like the Skechers boots I want, and like the UGGs   that I want.&nbsp;</p>
</DIV>
