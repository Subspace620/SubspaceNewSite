			<h3 class="title">Why Thingamablog and not x?</h3>
			
			<p>
	  Now some people out there may be wondering why Thingamablog was selected 
	  to be the engine behind the subspace 620 news page. The reason for that 
	  is very simple. The University of Alberta's server, upon which subspace 
	  620's website is hosted, does not allow any cgi scripting (PHP or 
	  otherwise).
	</p>
	<p>
	  There you go. That was easy, wasn't it?
	</p>
	<p>
	  Now some of you may be wondering what the full story is behind 
	  Thingamablog's eventual addition to this website. That story starts well 
	  over a year and a half ago when I first started to work on updating 
	  subspace 620's website...
	</p>
	<p>
	  As part of my election promises as well as part of some general 
	  discussions just before being elected president I decided that updating 
	  the subspace 620's website was long overdue (Considering that the crew 
	  manifest page was 2-3 years out of date at the time). So i started with 
	  a first draft update of the site: updating some basic facts, fixing old 
	  and out of date links, etc. all in PHP &amp; HTML. I was planning on using 
	  some sort of PHP based blogging engine, or maybe even a forum engine, 
	  for the news portion of the site along with a few other updates that 
	  would have made the site feel a fair bit less like the club was still 
	  living it up in the year 1999 (not that there is anything particularily 
	  wrong with the style of the website but you know how it is...).
	</p>
	<p>
	  It wasn't until I decided to give my update a test run that i discovered 
	  that PHP was not supported on the University's servers. Since this 
	  problem meant redoing all the work i'd already done I put off the update 
	  for a while so i could get back on track with homework as well as figure 
	  out a new plan for the site update itself.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The next attempt of updating the site came about a year and a quarter 
	  ago. I'd written some perl scripts to automate some of my work for me 
	  and stuck to mostly just fixing informational problems with the site. 
	  Finally I was ready to hit the news page problem again. This time the 
	  plan was to use a perl cgi blogging engine named blosxom since it looked 
	  easy to use (had a test one already running on my laptop) and since the 
	  server had perl installed I figured it would work for what I needed. It 
	  wasn't until I uploaded the new version of the website that I realized 
	  that not even perl cgi pages were allowed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Now this was a problem but I had to get back to work on homework so I 
	  left things sit, with the site mostly updated and a news page that threw 
	  an error at you since its cgi scripts couldn't work.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Time passed again and my term as president was up with me heading off to 
	  Toronto for a 16 month intership. After getting settled in I finally 
	  gave it another go, building an updated version of the site and finally 
	  coming across Thingamablog for the first time. With a few quick tests I 
	  figured it would work so I set the site aside while I worked on some 
	  other stuff. Six months later, here we are and I finally have returned 
	  to update the website again, with new information on the executive 
	  members and for the first time in 3-4 years, an up to date news feed (a 
	  working one too!).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Now for those of you wondering, Thingamablog is a blog updating engine 
	  that runs on my laptop that allows me to build a blog and entries. When 
	  i'm done with an entry, I just save it and hit the upload button at 
	  which point it drops the blog onto the university's server as flat and 
	  reliable old HTML. If you are interested in learning more about 
	  Thingamablog, do visit their <a href="http://www.thingamablog.com/">website</a>.

	  Thanks for listening and talk to you soon.
