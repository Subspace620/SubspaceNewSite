<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">What do we know about Rob? Well, he's obviously
mentally unstable. His history with, former, Lt. Gillespie was always a
joking one. The incident with the Aurora Borealis life form and the former
Lt. Krista caused many tensions and threats of hunting excursions to solve
the problem. It hasn't been proven that it was that specific incident that
caused his instability. Since he's an anthropology buff, perhaps he's just
studying the social behavior patterns of the Trekker. You think there's
a thesis in that? He has learned of Captain Gillespie's "Hidden Agenda"
and plans to keep close tabs on him from his new position.<!--Test html file--></FONT>
