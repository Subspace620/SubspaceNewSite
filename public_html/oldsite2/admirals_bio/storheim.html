<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><u><span lang="EN-US">Name</span></u><span lang="EN-US">: 
Betheiah “Beth” Storheim</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><u><span lang="EN-US">Age</span></u><span lang="EN-US">: 
21 years this October (which still makes me younger than everyone else in this 
club---damn!)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><u><span lang="EN-US">Obviously 
Fictional, and Badly Written, Bio</span></u><span lang="EN-US">: After making 
the great trek to the Academy in the Univas Albertus system all the way from 
planet Northglenora in the Westmountus system (just across the Muddy Way/Northsask 
Nebula), Beth was very happy to be alive. After participating in Orientation for 
the Academy, she happened upon a “buspass” dealer, and purchased one of these 
handy items with the last block of gold-pressed latinum she possessed. With 
this, she was able to attain warp speed and travel all the way home in less than 
one quarter of a Terran hour. From then on, she never needed to walk again, and 
so grew fat and lazy and very fond of trans-fat laden foods. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
<span lang="EN-US">After a time, however, her motorized wheelchair became quite 
uncomfortable, and she longed to find a newer, comfier chair to sit in. After 
much searching, she happened upon a strange little tribe that inhabited the far 
reaches of the sixth level of the SUB station. This little tribe loved to watch 
movies and TV shows all day long and do little else. Though Beth did find them 
to be a cute, cuddly and rather entertaining bunch, Beth found little else that 
was interesting about them. But just as she was about to depart to continue on 
her search, she noticed a grey chair sitting in the corner of the tribe’s 
quarters. Suddenly, her eyes lit up as she dashed towards the chair, and sat on 
it. Immediately her rear end felt more comfortable and more at-ease than it ever 
had before. But the little tribe saw all of this, and proceeded to tell their 
tribal leader, whose name was Ama Ndablunt. When Ama Ndablunt heard the news, 
her teeth began to grind, and she started to snort and growl with boiling rage, 
the likes of which none of her tribesmen had seen before. She then stormed out 
into the gathering room and rushed at Beth, her eyes ablaze and her claws 
outstretched, ready to gouge Beth’s eyes out with one fell swoop. You see, Beth 
had inadvertently sat in Ama Ndablunt’s special chair, and NO ONE was to sit in 
that chair except for Ama Ndablunt, or else they would invite her terrible wrath 
upon them. Somehow, Beth managed to spring out of Ama Ndablunt’s chair and back 
into her own motorized chair, just in time to speed away from Ama Ndablunt’s 
scratching claws and gnashing teeth. As Beth sped away with all the speed her 
trusty chair could muster, she heard the piercing, savage screams of Ama 
Ndablunt behind her, and Beth immediately regretted that she wasn’t able to sit 
in that comfy grey chair longer. Her butt was already growing sore again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
<span lang="EN-US">Many years later, as Beth was wandering aimlessly around the 
Academy campus, one of the tribesmen that she had seen years before came up to 
her. At first Beth was frightened, but the tribesman held his hand up as a sign 
of peace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
<span lang="EN-US">“I mean you no harm, O chair-dweller! I bring you good 
tidings! Our leader Ama Ndablunt has died, after running into a cement wall very 
fast and going into a coma. She was a brave leader, Ama Ndablunt, but alas, she 
grew quite insane in the last few years, and had become very savage and brutal 
to her subjects (we think it may have been all the many years she was forced to 
deal with the Es-Yu people and the Dekesians). This is why I have come to seek 
you out, O chair-dweller---we wish that you might become our new leader. You 
showed great courage that day when you fled the terrible wrath of Ama Ndablunt. 
Not one of us could have sprung out of that chair as you did! We would have 
surely frozen stiff with terror when faced with such awful savagery. So, great 
chair-dweller, will you lead us? Please say yes, so that I may not be forced to 
assume such great and awesome responsibility.” The tribesman later said his name 
was “Chris”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
<span lang="EN-US">As Beth came to grasp with this sudden request, she then 
remembered that comfortable grey chair.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
<span lang="EN-US">“Ah!” she thought to herself. “At long last I finally get 
what I’ve always wanted: The comfy chair!” Of course, she immediately accepted 
Chris’ request, and became the tribe’s leader. To this day, she still sits 
there, drooling all over herself in complete comfort and relaxation. But the 
tribesmen (and tribeswomen) don’t care, so long as someone else can go slowly 
insane instead of one of them.</span></p>
