<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Jared joined the starship Subspace 620 immediately after moving to the Univas Albertus System.  Even as an <br />
Ensign Jared was praised for his enthusiasm.  The starship had fallen into a routine of one movie mission per<br />
week and Jared saw room for improvement.  He realized that the ship had potential to be used for much more.<br />
<br />
During his first year he organized the first games mission and gained the nickname "games night guy".  Starfleet<br />
realized that this was this kind of progress that the starship 620 needed and they promptly promoted him to Captain <br />
at the beginning of his second year.  His two years as Captain marked an age of expansion for the club.  He first<br />
added weekly games missions to the club, then he added weekly book missions to the club.  By the end of this reign<br />
as Captain, the ship was busier than ever and well known among the Univas Albertus System.  In 2013 he was promoted<br />
to Admiral but continues to help advise the crew of the starship Subspace 620 to this day.
