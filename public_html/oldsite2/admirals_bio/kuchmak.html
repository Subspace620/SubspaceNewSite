	<td vAlign="top" colSpan="2">Chris has been around the fleet and back.&nbsp; 
	When he joined Starfleet nobody in his family would support him. He has 
	since proved himself by taking vacations in the mountainous regions of 
	Crow's-nest Pass on Impeesa Prime.&nbsp; He has had an exemplary record 
	aboard Subspace 620 moving up in the ranks quickly.
	<p>His future plans 
	include returning to Starfleet Academy and teaching the future of Starfleet. As 
	well as making the Station itself more than just a backwater in the Univas 
	Albertus system.&nbsp; Nearby is Vulcan which he has already visited once 
	with intentions to return.</p>
	<p>He likes the primitive games of hockey, football, and soccer; and he 
	enjoys a good beer... preferably a Thirsty Beaver. <br>
