<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
After joining the club in september 2006, Joel attendeed a number of events
before being elected to the position of extended executive. While holding the
position of extended executive, Joel organized some events and held regular
office hours as per constitutional requirments. Partway through the year, Joel
was appointed to be the club's webmaster and took over responsibility of the
cub's website, ualberta email address and a moderator role on the mailing list.
Near the end of the year he began looking updating the website to have more
accurate information. He was then elected to the position of president for the
2009-2010 school year.
</p>
<p>
Upon taking office as President, plans were put in motion to clean up the office
and work began on the project over the summer of 2009. By the fall, the
construction phase of the office clean-up was ready to begin. Over the fall, the
club acquired a new desk, couch, shelves and built a raised floor in the
'bathroom'-closet. Joel also proposed and got passed a constitutional
ammendement that brought the constitution up to date with modern club practices
as well as installing new rules for on-line elections and officially updating
the club's name to include the term 'fantasy'. As the school year progressed
there were also a few updates to the website. As the years end approached, Joel
organized and ran the club's firt online elections (not counting the
constitutional ammendment) and stepped down in preparation for a 16 month
internship at IBM.

While on Intership, assisted remortely with a few adminsistrative actions as
well as overhauling the club website.

running the weekly movie night before establishing a second weekly movie night
on Tusday in addition to the primary one on wednesday. At end of winter term,

Farewell to the club and good luck to it and all of its members.
