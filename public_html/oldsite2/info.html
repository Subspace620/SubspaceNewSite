<p align="left"><h3>General Information</h3></p>

<p align="left">
The SubSpace 620 Science Fiction and Fantasy Club is all about fun and
fellowship. It's not easy being a sci-fi or fantasy fan without getting a few
weird looks from people...even if your not wearing a costume let alone own a
costume. WE ARE a social club for people who like this genre of writing, though
TV, Books, Movies, Radio, or Games. WE STRIVE to make the best of our University
Years by having fun, and know that inside everyone who snubs us and every time
we get bashed by some character in the Gateway, we know that inside those people
a little bit of love for the genre is trying to get out.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks to Jeff Shyluk we can better place the start of the club to be sometime near or before 1987. 25 years now! It has been quite the run.
	If you have any info on how old the club is contact us: <a href="mailto:subspace@ualberta.ca?subject=history">on our hailing frequency</a>.
	We'd love to hear from you.
</p>

<p align="left">The Club itself is a member 
run club. The Executive is only here to facilitate and run/make sure the events 
are legal and take place. It is up to the members at large to say what they want 
to do. </p>

<h3> Events </h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		General Meetings (to Procrastinate and make plans for outings)
	</li>
	<li>
		Outings include: Movie Nights, Premieres, Marathons/Parties, Board Game
		nights, Laser Quest and Bowling where you could win the Locutus of Bowl
		trophy.
	<ul>
		<li>
		This year we will continue doing weekly movie nights in the CSC common area and are
		starting up a monthly games night. Check our 
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/subspace620/">facebook
		group page</a> or the <a href="news/blog.html">news section</a>
		for more information.
		</li>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		At the start of every school year we run a potluck barbeque (usually in Emily
		Murphy park near the University).
	<li>
		Whatever MEMBERS wanna do......the club is a member run group so if you
		wanna do something let the Command staff know or post it to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/subspace620/">Facebook group!</a>
