<h3>They boldly went... and caused a great deal of 
chaos.</h3>
<p>Here is a brief history of the ships to proudly 
bear the flag of our club: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr align="left">
<p><h4><i>U.S.S. Hully-Gully</i>, Constitution class<br>
Starfleet Registry NCC-8485</h4></p>
<p>
Crew complement: <i>430</i> <br>
Commissioned: <i>Feb 2243</i> <br>
Decommissioned: <i>Nov 2271</i>
</p>

<p>Bridge commander: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
	<b>Captain Earl Woods</b> (2243 - 2262)
	<br>
	<b>Captain Anthony Longworth</b> (2262 - 2271)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With Dr. Richard Daystrom's monumental 
invention of duotronics, Starfleet entered a new era of spacecraft technology, 
beginning with the new Constitution class vessels. Among the first of those to 
be commissioned was the <i>U.S.S. Hully-Gully</i>, placed under the command of 
Earl Woods, a brash upstart with a thirst for adventure.
</p>
<p>
It seems fitting that while on course to their 
first mission in the Archanis Sector, an unanticipated glitch in the ship's 
systems resulted in instrument failure, causing the ship to stray over three 
light-years off course. The source of the malfunction was traced to an 
accident-prone ensign who carelessly tipped a cup of coffee over a control 
console while repairing a bipolar electromagnetic converter. Not wishing to 
appear too autocratic in his discipline style, Captain Woods confined the ensign 
to quarters to contemplate his behaviour until they reached the next starbase 
for repairs.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the affected instrumentation, the trip took eighteen months.
</p>
<p>
Even with this initial setback, Captain Woods 
still went on to lead the <i>Hully-Gully</i> on to many thrilling experiences in 
nearly twenty years of service, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>First contact missions to Benzar, Brentalia, 
  Ligos II and Xanthras III </li>
  <li>Prevented an outbreak of Hranilaki brain 
  fever in the Modean System </li>
  <li>Thwarted attack by two Klingon 
  battlecruisers during an astrological survey in the Mutara Sector </li>
  <li>Attacked and boarded by Orion pirates, but 
  able to outsmart the marauders and regain control of the ship </li>
</ul>

<p>
In 2262 Captain Woods was finally recognized 
for his outstanding field work with a promotion to Admiral and DIrector of 
Starfleet Personnel. ANthony Longworth was assigned as his replacement as 
captain of the <i>Hully-Gully</i>. Captain Longworth's accomplishments were 
somewhat overshadowed by another brash upstart named James Kirk, who assumed 
command of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i> a few short years later. Nonetheless, he 
preserved the tenets of the Federation throughout his posting. In particular, 
the <i>Hully-Gully</i> was honoured in its selection as the ambassadorial escort 
to the Pelleus peace conference in 2266, and assigned to several missions 
involving defensive patrols of the Klingon Neutral Zone.
</p>
<p>
Captain Longworth's tenure aboard the <i>Hully-Gully</i> 
ended prematurely in 2271 when the ship was diverted to an emergency course to 
the Sol System, when Earth faced the threat from the V'Ger entity. Thankfully, 
the crisis was averted without severe incident, but the <i>Hully-Gully</i> 
wasn't quite as fortunate. Spacedock recalled the Constitution class vessel to 
perform an assessment for upgrade. While the <i>Hully-Gully</i>'s spacefaring 
condition should have been more than adequate to merit a complete systems 
upgrade, a bureaucratic decision resulted in its decommissioning. Some 
speculated that the decision was driven by certain members of Starfleet who 
wanted to phase out the Constitution class vessels in favour of beginning 
development of the new Excelsior class starship design.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr align="left">
<p><h4><i>U.S.S. Oblivious</i>, Constitution class<br>
Starfleet Registry NCC-9091</h4></p>
<p>
Crew complement: <i>430</i> <br>
Commissioned: <i>Oct 2250</i> <br>
Refit: <i>Feb 2272</i> <br>
Decommissioned: <i>Apr 2297</i>
</p>

<p>Bridge commander: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Captain Andrew 'Andy' Connelly</b> (2272 - 2284) <br>
  <b>Captain Jim Sandercock</b> (2284 - 2297)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <i>U.S.S. Oblivious</i> was one of the last 
of the original Constitution class starships to be upgraded, having completed 
its fourth five-year tour in 2271. With modifications completed in early 2272 
the <i>Oblivious</i> was turned over to the command of Andrew Connelly, who 
proudly took on the club banner on his first mission as a starship captain.
</p>
<p>
Based on Connelly's training in the scientific 
disciplines, the <i>Oblivious</i> spent most of its time on missions of 
exploration, but it also participated in a number of peace-keeping endeavours. 
These diplomatic assignments ultimately influenced Andy's way of thinking. He 
began impressing the values of friendship and cooperation on to the members of 
his crew, who weren't always receptive to his cajoling. Dissention among the 
lower ranks grew as Captain Connelly instituted such unorthodox policies as 
weekly hug therapy, work shift buddies, &quot;feel good&quot; food menus and community 
bathing.
</p>
<p>
An ugly situation was slowly developing, but 
was precluded from occurring when a militant political faction on Caladan IV 
kidnapped the captain, intending to blackmail the Federation into supporting 
them in a civil dispute. The crew of the <i>Oblivious</i> wasted no time in 
sacrificing Captain Connelly, &quot;[sending] a clear message that the Federation 
would not be bullied into any society's internal problems.&quot; Commander Jim 
Sandercock, the first officer of the <i>Oblivious</i>, was given the captain's 
chair and a promotion as reward for properly handling the incident. His first 
action as captain was to abolish Captain Connelly's abridged regulations, much 
to the crew's approval.
</p>
<p>
The role of the <i>Oblivious</i> as a peace 
keeper changed from a passive stance to a more defensive one, often assigned to 
patrol both the Klingon and Romulan borders. Captain Connelly was also assigned 
several missions of cultural observations, including the planets Sigma Draconis 
VI, Beta Antares IV, Gamma Trianguli VI, Ekos, and Betazed. It was based upon 
Captain Sandercock's recommendation that the Federation initiated first contact 
procedures with Betazed.
</p>
<p>
In a final footnote, the last mission of the <i>
Oblivious</i> before its retirement from service involved monitoring the Romulan 
Neutral Zone, after several outposts reported increased Romulan activity in 
Sector 27. The <i>Oblivious</i> did not encounter any disturbances during their 
six-month patrol, but long range sensor sweeps did verify increased traffic to a 
nearby uninhabited star system. This could have been the first signs ever 
detected leading up to the Tomed Incident in 2311, although this is pure 
speculation.

<hr align="left">
<p><h4><i>U.S.S. Incontinent</i>, Galaxy class<br>
Starfleet Registry NCC-19945</h4></p>

<p>
Crew complement: <i>1014</i> <br>
Commissioned: <i>Sep 2365</i> <br>
Decommissioned: <i>Jan 2367</i> </p>
<p>Bridge commander: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Captain George Skinner</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>U.S.S. Incontinent</i> has the dubious 
distinction of owning the shortest term as the club's flagship, though it 
certainly isn't the fault of Captain Skinner or his crew. The <i>Incontinent</i> 
was just barely broken in before it was called in to defend Earth from the Borg 
at Wolf 395. Captain Skinner was overheard screaming &quot;Run away! Run away!&quot; as 
all hands abandoned ship moments before it was completely destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Captain Skinner promptly retired from starship 
service, thereby setting the record as the shortest career as a starship captain 
in Starfleet history. Preferring to re-immerse himself in the engineering 
environments where he spent most of his career, Captain Skinner contented 
himself with a head position at Starfleet Research and Development. As an 
Admiral, he then went on to reside over the Engineering division of Starfleet 
Academy, before finally being promoted to Director of R&amp;D.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr align="left">
<p><h4><i>U.S.S. Inconceivable</i>, Intrepid class<br>
Starfleet Registry NCC-99596</h4></p>

<p>
Crew complement: <i>141</i> <br>
Commissioned: <i>Sep 2370</i> <br>
Active status </p>

<p>Bridge commander: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Captain Malmot</b> (2370 - 2373)
  <br>
  <b>Captain Robert L. Leddy</b> (2373)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When Starfleet assigned the <i>Inconceivable</i>, 
one of the new generation of starships to be recently commissioned, to COmmander 
Malmot, they beleived they were continuing the long-standing trend of great 
Vulcan starship captains. Naturally, the <i>Inconceivable</i>'s primary mission 
involved scientific study of interstellar phenomena.
</p>
<p>
In the late months of 2372 Starfleet 
Intelligence began receiving reports that the Romulan Star Empire was somehow 
receiving classified tactical and technological information regarding 
preparations to defend the Federation from a Gamma Quadrant invasion by the 
Dominion. SI immediately suspected infiltration by the founders. They thought 
they might have a suspect when Starfleet Headquarters received a Level 3 
encrypted message hidden within a standard log report from the <i>Inconceivable</i>. 
In it, Commander Robert Leddy alluded to Captain Malmot's suspect behaviour, 
noting several questionable command decisions over the past several months. The 
report prompted headquarters (under the advisement of SI) to recall the <i>
Inconceivable</i> to the nearest available starbase under the guise of a 
maintenance review in order to apprehend Captain Malmot for questioning. 
Unfortunately, Malmot somehow discovered the true motive for the ship's recall 
and managed to evade capture with the help of a cloaked Romulan Bird-of-Prey. 
With the <i>Inconceivable</i> completely disable, Malmot revealed himself to be 
an agent of the Star Empire (not a Founder as SI had expected). However, as the 
Romulan ship made its escape, Malmot vowed to bestow his revenge upon Commander 
Leddy for blowing his cover, however misguided the reason.
</p>

<hr align="left">
  
<p><h4><i>USS Costanza</i>, Promethius Class
<br>Starfleet Registry  NCC-200304</h4></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>Captain Amanda Blunt</b> (2373 - 2379)**<br>
	<font size="2">though she only had it for the last two years of her service 
	as Capt.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Costanza fought valiantly in the Tuition Wars in 2004 and 2005. In 2005 
however there was finally a minor victory in what has now been dubbed the War on 
Tuition. Unfortunetly it was heavily damaged in this fight and the Captain 
finally decided to move on to more silly things.
</p>


<hr align="left">
  
<p><h4><i>U.S.S. Irregardless</i>, Defiant Class<br>
Starfleet Registry NCC-200506</h4></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>Captain Beth (2379 - ????)</b></p>
</blockquote>

<hr align="left">
<h4>SubSpace 6-20, Federation orbital station<br>
Starfleet Registry SB-19978-620</h4>
<p>Crew complement: <i>65, with additional 112 
officers stand-by for flight missions</i> <br>
Constructed: <i>Mar 2373</i> <br>
Operational: <i>May 2373</i> </p>

<p>Station commander: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Captain Robert L. Leddy (2373)
  <br>Captain Amanda Blunt (2373 - 2379)
  <br>Captain Beth (2379- Present)
</blockquote>
</b>
<p>
Starfleet was rather hesitant to give Commander 
Leddy immediate command of the <i>Inconceivable</i>, perhaps because he had not 
earned enough command experience. However, given that Starfleet was still 
suffering from a shortage of command-rank officers following the Borg attack at 
Wolf 359, they had little choice but to promote Leddy to Captain. But to avoid 
risking further incident with the <i>Inconceivable</i>, Starfleet reassigned 
Captain Leddy to a communications base located in the Univas Albertus system 
that had just recently finished construction. The only current complexity was 
the remote location of the orbital station: most of the ship's crew would be 
literally stranded there until such time that another command staff could be 
transported to SubSpace 6-20 to retrieve the <i>Inconceivable</i> and the rest 
of the crew.
</p>

<p>
When the <i>Inconceivable</i> finally docked at 
the communications station, Captain Leddy debriefed the crew on their 
assignment: top priority was given to getting SubSpace 6-20 up to full 
operation, sending word of completion to Starfleet Command as confirmation. The 
crew was then instructed to await further orders from Command, most likely 
involving the retrieval of the <i>Inconceivable</i> and its crew.
</p>
<p>
After two months of honest effort, SubSpace 
6-20 was brought on-line, and the command staff waited with anticipation as the 
confirmation signal was broadcast back to command headquarters. And waited.
</p>
<p>And waited.... </p>
<p>Are you <i>sure</i> this thing's working?&nbsp; </p>

<p>
Captain Blunt was pressed into the command chair and subsequently lost the 
ship<i> U.S.S. Inconceivable</i> to the a faction of dissidents. Finally an answer 
from Command was received 4 years into 
Capt. Blunt's service, and the station received a support ship the USS Costanza.
</p>

<p>October 2006</p>
<p>Captain Beth is now into the second year of her presidency, Captain Blunt has been promoted to Fleet Admiral and givin her own ship to honour her work with the station for so long. Under Lt. Ang's persuasion, many new recruits have joined the station this year.</p>
<p>July 2007 </p>
<p>The newly and aptly named USS Blunt and a small crew brave the stars and travel to the Seattle Planet. There they toured numerous shops, and the female staff bought new shoes for their duty uniforms since on the way there Vice Admiral Chris threw out all the pairs of shoes before leaving planet Edmonton. The trip was a rousing success and hopfully many will join us for a trip to Vulcan in the near future! </p>
