<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Jacob was born and raised on Planet Calgary in the Bowium Nebula.  Soon after moving to the Univas Albertus System he joined the crew of the <br />
space ship Subspace 620 as an Ensign.  In a year he was promoted to the modest rank of Lt. Junior.  Jacob then served bravely under the glorious <br />
leadership of Captain Henze for two more years.  When Captain Henze was promoted to Admiral he was suceeded be Captain McLellan.  Unfortuantely <br />
Captain McLellan's reign as captain ended quickly and in disaster.  When taking the starship Subspace 620 on a routine diplomacy mission to the <br />
Bowium Nebula, the crew was ambushed in the Univas MountRoyalus System.  The ship was destroyed and Captain McLellan was taken prisoner.  She <br />
still lives in the MountRoyalus System to this day enduring unknown horrors. <br />
<br />
The crew survived the crash but was homeless and lost in an unknown system.  Being the most senior member of the crew and a local of the <br />
Bowium Nebula, the team looked to Jacob for leadership.  Using Jacob's contacts in the Bowium Nebula the crew returned home to the Univas Edmonton <br />
System to rebuild their ship.  Captain McLellan was deemed lost and Jacob was promoted to fill the void.  Currently Jacob is still working with <br />
the crew to rebuild their ship and once again give the crew a home. <br />
