			<p>
				Originally discovered on stardate 3141.9 Commander Chadwick was among the survivors of a "sleeper ship" called the Botany Bay from the late twentieth century discovered by the U.S.S. Enterprise. After a failed attempt to take control of the Enterprise with his leader (and rumoured half brother) Khan Noonian Singh. Chadwick and his genetically engineered superior intellect  was among Khan's crew of the Botany Bay exiled to Ceti Alpha V. During his years of exile on the once lush but now barren wasteland that is Ceti Alpha V, Chadwick realized the error of Khan's tyrannical rule and bided his time. Once Khan took control of the U.S.S Reliant, Chadwick saw this was his chance to escape, and daringly escaped in shuttlecraft moments before the ship entered the Mutara Nebula pursuing the Enterprise. (The nebula rendered the Reliants sensors useless, hence his escape went undetected for you "anal about detail" types out there). Some time later the shuttlecraft ran out of energy and Chadwick used his genetically engineered superior intellect to place himself in a state of suspended animation in the hopes he would one day be found.</br>
				Drifting aimlessly for five years, his shuttlecraft was picked up by the U.S.S Diuretic who dropped him off on Planet SLAVE ON FOODS. For five long years Chadwick and his genetically engineered superior intellect  toiled in the salt mines of Planet SLAVE ON FOODS. Surviving power mad crew chiefs, little pay, snotty cashiers, and terrible shifts, Chadwick and his genetically engineered superior intellect  saved enough gold pressed latinum to buy transport to earth where he joined Starfleet. His genetically engineered superior intellect allowed Chadwick to graduate Starfleet with distinction. His handling of the Kobayashi Maru scenario was unorthodox but had the distinction of never been done before. (He photon torpedoed the bejeezus out of the Kobayashi Maru, "Why the (expletive deleted) is the Kobayashi Maru in the neutral zone in the first place?" he arrogantly demanded,  and used his transporters to beam every piece of underwear he owned, both pairs, to the Klingon ships and he high tailed it out of the neutral zone. Upon graduating Starfleet Chadwick was assigned for a one year stint aboard the U.S.S. Grant MacKewan. Transferred in the fall of last year to Subspace 620 Chadwick was not involved in club activities as he would have liked to have been last year. Rumour has it his lack of involvement was because he was assigned to Tribble cleanup after he consumed too much Roumulan ale at a Starfleet function and called Captain Picard "...a bald pansy..", called Captain Janeway "... a bootylicious hot mama ..." and  told Captain Kirk that "...he fights really well for a fat guy in a toupee...". Returning this year and using his genetically engineered superior intellect  to quickly rise in the ranks from ensign to commander, Commander Chadwick Noonian Singh Mitchell pledges that this year he will find his Vulcan katra and "destroy with an iron fist all those who oppose his righteous rule and crush beneath him they who deny his genetically engineered superior intellect" ....er....ummm....he means have lots of fun this year...yeah...yeah that's it. Did he mention that he possesses genetically engineered superior intellect?.
