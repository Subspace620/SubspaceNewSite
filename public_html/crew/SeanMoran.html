				What’s up, fellow club members. It is I, the great SEAN MORAN, here to light up your days with my awkwardness! Around the club room, I’m known as the Video Gamer (unless Peter’s around, the darn title thief!). You can usually find me playing Red Dragon Inn if we’re in person, or Minecraft online on a number of servers.
				<br/><br/>
				Usually, if you see me around Campus, it’s either because I’m rushing to class or goofing off. I like to get involved with volunteer work, and even have an award for it! But mostly, I’m known for my cheery attitude and my friendly, if awkward, attempts to socialise with the people around me. I’m not known for my social skills, but I like to think that I make up for it with my cheerful attitude and willingness to try almost anything. No drugs though!
				<br/><br/>
				I joined the club within my first week at the university. I was lost on campus during WOW, looking for anything related to D&D, since I had just started playing it during my last year of high school and everyone in my group went to different universities. I actually got involved by running into Henry, our previous treasurer. No joke, I wasn’t paying attention and we ran into each other! He heard I was looking for D&D, and practically dragged me to the club table. That’s where I met Melissa and Lauren, and discovered that Lauren is MUCH better at chess than I was.
				<br/><br/>
				Somehow, even though I only had one campaign experience in D&D, I ended up as a DM to brand new players. It was an interesting experience, to say the least… The party ended up with a total wipe to a dragon. Then, I joined Josh’s campaign, where I also met Destiny, two of our other execs. I actually met Nic at the UofA Pokemon Club, believe it or not. It wasn’t until months after we met that we realized we were both in Subspace as well.
				<br/><br/>
				When elections came around, I was looking to get more involved with at least one of the clubs I was in. Since there were so few runners for the club elections, I kinda jumped on the wagon to be part of the bigger picture. I was all excited to do something… and then COVID struck. It’s been chaotic since, and we’re figuring out how to run the club virtually, but it hasn’t been perfect. Frankly, Subspace has become something of a family to me, to escape from the chaos that is my actual family and have somewhere else to go without thinking of the pandemic.
				<br/><br/>
				I don’t think any of us were ready for what 2020 brought us, and frankly, I think that it’s gonna be chaotic for a while, but I hope you will stay on this journey with us until the end of the line. Our journey? To boldly go where no club has gone before.
