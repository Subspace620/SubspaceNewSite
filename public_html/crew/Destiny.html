			<p>
				When choosing your name it is associated to your identity. Fatum translated to Fate in English. Fate translated to Destin in French. Destin translated to Destiny. This seemed close enough to her given title. Needing to be inconspicuous still, she chose her last name as Ducommun for its translate in French being “of the common.” 
				<br/><br/>
				With a name chosen for herself, Destiny made her approach to the humans at the university of Alberta. Her mission was to blend in, study their ways, and learn their quirks. Her study of humans outright was to obvious, so she chose Biology and Mathematics as her subject fields. Biology for her studies, and math because numbers just make sense.
				<br/><br/>
				Destiny found subspace for the D&D.  It fascinated her how humans could disassociate into their fictional characters. This became an amusing way of venting and practicing her new forms expression. She committed to helping the club through the trials titled antifreeze before committing to being fully involved with the club. Destiny became so enamoured with club life she decided she wanted to help run it as well. 
				<br/><br/>
				If by some chance you see Destiny in the wild feel free to approach her. She accepts food bribes and deep insightful conversation. A warning to all before approaching her though, where she goes chaos seems to follow. While she is not the harbinger of this herself, she recognizes the amusement and insanity factors in cultivating chaos.
				<br/><br/>
				In her own experience. The hardest lessons for Destiny to learn about being human are:
				<br/>-To be stronger than the hardships that life offers.
				<br/>-Life is not a competition.
				<br/>-Earth sustenance is quite enjoyable to consume.
