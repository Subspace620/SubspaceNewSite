				<p>
					We will be having our executive elections for 2020/2021. During the whole month of March, our candidates can answer questions about their future governance of the club in our 
					discord's #elections channel. During the last week of March, elections will happen online through a google form, like what we did last year after COVID-19 hit.<br/>

					Current applicants include:

					<h4>What positions are you interested in?</h4>
					<p>
						Captain / President<br/>
						 Lieutenant / Extended Exec<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What responsibilities are you interested in?</h4>
					<p>
						DnD Scheduling (16-20 hours/semester + 1 hour/week)<br/>
						 Boardgame Nights (5-8 hours/week)<br/>
						 Movie Nights (2-5 hours/week)<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>Why do you care about this club?</h4>
					<p>
						I've made a lot of good friends through this club, and I want to be able for other people to have the same chance! Also, the in-person board game nights were some of the most fun I've had on campus. <br/>
					</p>
					<h4>How long have you been in the club?</h4>
					<p>
						A little bit over a year, but it's been a really enjoyable year with this club, even if there has been a pandemic happening.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What makes you a good candidate?</h4>
					<p>
						I have a really good understanding of how the club works, and what needs to happen so that it can continue to function the same. I'm also really passionate about this club, and try my best to make sure it's a fun place for everyone who's here! <br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What plans do you have if you get elected?</h4>
					<p>
						I want to try and have collaborative events between different clubs and us, as well as organize more consistent weekly and monthly in-club events. This would be especially true if we are allowed to return to in-person interactions on campus, as real-life interactions seem to be more fruitful! I also want to ensure that the club is a place where people can continue to be comfortable being themselves.<br/>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Why should people vote for you?</h4>
					<p>
						I want to help maintain the club for future classes of students to be able to enjoy in a similar way to what we've all come to enjoy. I feel like this club has presented a lot of fun opportunities for lots of people over the years, and I want to be able to proudly say that I helped contribute to tradition. <br/>
					</p>
					<h4>On a scale of A to Z, with Q being the highest, how would you rank your commitment to the club?</h4>
					<p>
						Hmm... Q... There's a designation I haven't heard in a long time. Last time must have been when we were running the data scams back in back in the Old City. I think our runner was jacked into the warehouse's netports when the one who had been Q before sold us out to the local scavengers. So naturally Redpile fried his internal circuits and passed off the designation to me. I think he would have taken it for himself, but he didn't like the notoriety that came with such a... well-positioned designation. Either that, or maybe he thought he could use it as leverage if the corporates caught him. But that's life I guess... Probably didn't hurt our chances either when we busted the cryptomed person out of the space elevator. Of course, it's not the Space Elevator that was a marvel of the scientific and engineering communities, but rather that abandoned site in the Azores after the revolution over there. Such a tragedy that one, there were people who could have helped us all if they'd survived. <br/>

						 Discord Community Moderation/Networking<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>Why do you care about this club?</h4>
					<p>
						I care about this club because it's the first place I really found friends, and I hope to keep that as a possibility for others in the future.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>How long have you been in the club?</h4>
					<p>
						I've been with the club since Fall 2019, so about a year and a half now.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What makes you a good candidate?</h4>
					<p>
						I've been a Lieutenant already once this past session, and while I cannot currently commit to higher responsibilities, I want to keep helping out where I can. Also regarding the Discord Community Moderation and Networking, I currently run about 3 different Discords and moderate for another 4, so I have the experience.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What plans do you have if you get elected?</h4>
					<p>
						I plan to do my best to help everyone around, and if the possibility allows, potentially create a more organized video game group and role for players.<br/>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Why should people vote for you?</h4>
					<p>
						As stated before, I have the experience. I'm also plenty excited about this club existing, and I want to keep it going however I can.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>On a scale of A to Z, with Q being the highest, how would you rank your commitment to the club?</h4>
					<p>
						I'd probably have to rank my commitment as a really bad dad joke being shared by a newborn T-Rex.<br/>

					</p>
					<h4>Why do you care about this club?</h4>
					<p>
						This club is the only remaining connection that I truly have to the University of Alberta. Subspace is the only reason I stayed when even my funding was cut off.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>How long have you been in the club?</h4>
					<p>
						Two years, long enough to know that this can be a big deal for humans.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What makes you a good candidate?</h4>
					<p>
						I get deeply involved with that which I involve myself in. I have seen what this club has been, and what it could be.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What plans do you have if you get elected?</h4>
					<p>
						I will help keep things running as long as things are all online, and I will push to reinstate the clubs glory when things go back in person.<br/>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Why should people vote for you?</h4>
					<p>
						It’s Fate. At this point it seems like more of a given.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>On a scale of A to Z, with Q being the highest, how would you rank your commitment to the club?</h4>
					<p>
						My commitment definitely is not as high online, though I would have to say my commitment level is similar in nature to a jet pack dolphin committed to finding the poacher who took his family.<br/>

					<h4>Why do you care about this club?</h4>
					<p>
						Once upon a time there was a first year student (or possibly plural students, three raccoons masquerading under a single CCID, but shhh) who went to clubs fair during her orientation, as one does. At this clubs fair, a certain club that starts with Sub and ends in Space was being tabled, and she had their programming quite aggressively pitched to her. She doesn't know why. Maybe it was fate, maybe she simply looked like an easy pitching mark. Out of sheer intimidation, she signed up for their emailing list. It has been just under 2 years, 1 pandemic, and 4.5 D&D campaigns since then, and she's still here. One would suspect it's no longer because of intimidation. In fact, one could quite safely say that she likes this whole science fiction and fantasy thing, she's made friends here, and generally considers this a pretty chill space.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>How long have you been in the club?</h4>
					<p>
						Since September 2019<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What makes you a good candidate?</h4>
					<p>
						As not one but three raccoons, I bring to the table three times the opposable thumbs of your average candidate, for three times the productivity. Also possibly three times the, uh, loose fur and a distinct fear of large owls, dogs and loud noises, but that's beyond the point. I may be inexperienced at this whole ... bipedal walking thing, but rest assured one does not need to be passably human to have an appreciation for the wonderous pop culture humans have created. I consume science fiction and fantasy books at an alarming rate (and by that I mean I read them, I don't eat them! I may be a procyonid but I'm not a savage!), know a decent amount about D&D, and have three times the normal human amount of enthusiasm for learning more.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>What plans do you have if you get elected?</h4>
					<p>
						1. Panic. 2. Regret filling out this form. 3. Get the book club going. 4. Buy a more professional looking trench coat.<br/>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Why should people vote for you?</h4>
					<p>
						That's a good question. I'm rather terrible at this whole pitching thing, like if I were a used car salesman I'd sell negative cars. People would pull an Uno reverse card and sell ME their cars as I was trying to sell THEM my cars because I'd feel so awkward about pitching my cars that I'd make it sound as though not only my cars but all cars were so terrible that they'd be much better off saving their money and buying a nice commuter bicycle. So uh, please vote for me so that I have something to do other than become a used car salesman and singlehandedly destroy the automobile industry.<br/>
					</p>
					<h4>On a scale of A to Z, with Q being the highest, how would you rank your commitment to the club?</h4>
					<p>
						Hmm has to be a solid 2^n with n being the square root of the number of sessions I've played D&D with y'all. I like it here, and y'all are going to be stuck with me regardless of whether I'm an exec. Keep up the great work, Subspace <3<br/>
