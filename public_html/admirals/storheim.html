			<p>
				After making the great trek to the Academy in the Univas Albertus system all the way from planet Northglenora in the Westmountus system
				(just across the Muddy Way/Northsask Nebula), Beth was very happy to be alive. After participating in Orientation for the Academy, she 
				happened upon a “buspass” dealer, and purchased one of these handy items with the last block of gold-pressed latinum she possessed. With 
				this, she was able to attain warp speed and travel all the way home in less than one quarter of a Terran hour. From then on, she never 
				needed to walk again, and so grew fat and lazy and very fond of trans-fat laden foods. <br/>
				<br/>
				After a time, however, her motorized wheelchair became quite uncomfortable, and she longed to find a newer, comfier chair to sit in. After
				much searching, she happened upon a strange little tribe that inhabited the far reaches of the sixth level of the SUB station. This little
				tribe loved to watch movies and TV shows all day long and do little else. Though Beth did find them to be a cute, cuddly and rather 
				entertaining bunch, Beth found little else that was interesting about them. But just as she was about to depart to continue on her search, 
				she noticed a grey chair sitting in the corner of the tribe’s quarters. Suddenly, her eyes lit up as she dashed towards the chair, and sat 
				on it. Immediately her rear end felt more comfortable and more at-ease than it ever had before. But the little tribe saw all of this, and 
				proceeded to tell their tribal leader, whose name was Ama Ndablunt. When Ama Ndablunt heard the news, her teeth began to grind, and she 
				started to snort and growl with boiling rage, the likes of which none of her tribesmen had seen before. She then stormed out into the 
				gathering room and rushed at Beth, her eyes ablaze and her claws outstretched, ready to gouge Beth’s eyes out with one fell swoop. You see,
				Beth had inadvertently sat in Ama Ndablunt’s special chair, and NO ONE was to sit in that chair except for Ama Ndablunt, or else they would
				invite her terrible wrath upon them. Somehow, Beth managed to spring out of Ama Ndablunt’s chair and back into her own motorized chair, 
				just in time to speed away from Ama Ndablunt’s scratching claws and gnashing teeth. As Beth sped away with all the speed her trusty chair 
				could muster, she heard the piercing, savage screams of Ama Ndablunt behind her, and Beth immediately regretted that she wasn’t able to sit
				in that comfy grey chair longer. Her butt was already growing sore again. <br/>
				<br/>
				Many years later, as Beth was wandering aimlessly around the Academy campus, one of the tribesmen that she had seen years before came up to 
				her. At first Beth was frightened, but the tribesman held his hand up as a sign of peace. <br/>
				<br/>
				“I mean you no harm, O chair-dweller! I bring you good tidings! Our leader Ama Ndablunt has died, after running into a cement wall very 
				fast and going into a coma. She was a brave leader, Ama Ndablunt, but alas, she grew quite insane in the last few years, and had become 
				very savage and brutal to her subjects (we think it may have been all the many years she was forced to deal with the Es-Yu people and the 
				Dekesians). This is why I have come to seek you out, O chair-dweller---we wish that you might become our new leader. You showed great 
				courage that day when you fled the terrible wrath of Ama Ndablunt. Not one of us could have sprung out of that chair as you did! We would 
				have surely frozen stiff with terror when faced with such awful savagery. So, great chair-dweller, will you lead us? Please say yes, so 
				that I may not be forced to assume such great and awesome responsibility.” The tribesman later said his name was “Chris”. <br/>
				<br/>
				As Beth came to grasp with this sudden request, she then remembered that comfortable grey chair. <br/>
				<br/>
				“Ah!” she thought to herself. “At long last I finally get what I’ve always wanted: The comfy chair!” Of course, she immediately accepted 
				Chris’ request, and became the tribe’s leader. To this day, she still sits there, drooling all over herself in complete comfort and 
				relaxation. But the tribesmen (and tribeswomen) don’t care, so long as someone else can go slowly insane instead of one of them.
