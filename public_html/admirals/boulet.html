			<h2 class="content-subhead">Background</h2>
			<p>
				After joining the club in September 2006, Joel attended a number of events before being elected to the position of extended executive. 
				While holding the position of extended executive, Joel organized some events and held regular office hours as per constitutional 
				requirements. Partway through the year, Joel was appointed to be the club's web-master and took over responsibility of the cub's website, 
				ualberta email address and a moderator role on the mailing list. Near the end of the year he began looking updating the website to have 
				more accurate information. He was then elected to the position of president for the 2009-2010 school year.<br/>
				<br/>
				Upon taking office as President, plans were put in motion to clean up the office and work began on the project over the summer of 2009. By 
				the fall, the construction phase of the office clean-up was ready to begin. Over the fall, the club acquired a new desk, couch, shelves and 
				built a raised floor in the 'bathroom'-closet. Joel also proposed and got passed a constitutional amendment that brought the 
				constitution up to date with modern club practices as well as installing new rules for on-line elections and officially updating the club's 
				name to include the term 'fantasy'. As the school year progressed there were also a few updates to the website. As the years end 
				approached, Joel organized and ran the club's first online elections (not counting the constitutional amendment) and stepped down in 
				preparation for a 16 month internship at IBM.<br/>
				<br/>
				While on Intership, assisted remotely with a few administrative actions as well as overhauling the club website. <br/>
				<br/>
				Upon returning to Edmonton at the close of Internship, joined President Jared in running the weekly movie night before establishing a 
				second weekly movie night on Tuesday in addition to the primary one on Wednesday. At end of winter term, handed off website responsibility 
				to the new members.  <br/>
				<br/>
				In Fall of 2017 his assistance enabled President Jonathon to begin updating the website to the most recent version. He's been available 
				to answer questions about the club's history and the website. In March of 2018 for his exceptional effort and contributions to the club 
				over the years, Joel Boulet was promoted to the rank of Fleet Admiral.
