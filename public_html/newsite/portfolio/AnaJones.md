To all whom it may concern: the current holder (henceforth referred to as "the individual") of this position was found to be a person of interest to the Board of Acquisitions, suspected of breaching nanite expulsion laws enacted by the CEO of Planet Terra, space subregion 620.

Preliminary analysis of contacts known to the individual suggests a willingness to help maintain organisations they believe encourage or foster community dynamics, at the expense of their internalised fears. This has been further verified through their involvement in many different organisations and para-social gatherings. The status of this individual's current position, while not in violation of virus standards set by the CEO's word, do currently suggest a temporary nature, or one that remains ultimately unknown.
  
Further information regarding the individual is to be reported to the Captain or administration with utmost haste. The individual is not considered a threat to public control, and may further be useful for the continued application of the status-quo.
  
As a final reminder to anyone reading this report, you are at home with The Company. Believe in the simulations. Everyone is loved in Our caring arms.
