                            Assimilated into the Star Trek Universe, due to parental units, not much is known about her. 
                            Just transferred from the U.S.S. McGill. Likes to haggle with Ferengi and that she has 
                            frequent flyer mileage to Sickbay (You name it, she's broken it, bruised it, sprained it, 
                            torn it and pulled it) and is proud of it. Was promoted to Lt. Commander Jody's position 
                            after Commander Jo asked for a demotion and Jody became Vice- President. Captain Blunt 
                            commanded SubSpace for 4 years before getting her own support ship the USS Costanza NCC-200304. 
                            Which she valiantly commanded for 2 more years before being promoted to Admiral in April 2005. 
                            The reasons for the promotion depend on who you ask. Starfleet states that it was due to her 
                            exlempary service, while the crew claims that it was to to preserve their sanity from not only 
                            her 'pythonisms', but to keep her from doing more damage to the computer systems. She stayed 
                            around but only in an advisory role. Her future plans include converting many youngsters to 
                            Pythonism.

                            After joining the club in September 2006, Joel attended a number of events before being elected to the 
                            position of extended executive. While holding the position of extended executive, Joel organized some 
                            events and held regular office hours as per constitutional requirements. Partway through the year, Joel 
                            was appointed to be the club's web-master and took over responsibility of the cub's website, ualberta 
                            email address and a moderator role on the mailing list. Near the end of the year he began looking updating 
                            the website to have more accurate information. He was then elected to the position of president for the 
                            2009-2010 school year.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Upon taking office as President, plans were put in motion to clean up the office and work began on the 
                            project over the summer of 2009. By the fall, the construction phase of the office clean-up was ready to 
                            begin. Over the fall, the club acquired a new desk, couch, shelves and built a raised floor in the 'bathroom'
                            -closet. Joel also proposed and got passed a constitutional amendment that brought the constitution up to 
                            date with modern club practices as well as installing new rules for on-line elections and officially updating 
                            the club's name to include the term 'fantasy'. As the school year progressed there were also a few updates 
                            to the website. As the years end approached, Joel organized and ran the club's first online elections (not 
                            counting the constitutional amendment) and stepped down in preparation for a 16 month internship at IBM.
                            <br/><br/>
                            While on Intership, assisted remotely with a few administrative actions as well as overhauling the club website.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Upon returning to Edmonton at the close of Internship, joined President Jared in running the weekly movie night 
                            before establishing a second weekly movie night on Tuesday in addition to the primary one on Wednesday. At end 
                            of winter term, handed off website responsibility to the new members.
                            <br/><br/>
                            In Fall of 2017 his assistance enabled President Jonathon to begin updating the website to the most recent version. 
                            He's been available to answer questions about the club's history and the website. In March of 2018 for his exceptional 
                            effort and contributions to the club over the years, Joel Boulet was promoted to the rank of Fleet Admiral.

                            Yo, Lauren here. Where do I begin... I'm genderfluid, I'm polyamorous, I'm asexual! 
                            More specifically I'm genderfae(fluidly feminine, demi-girl, agender but never any 
                            masculine genders). I'm egalitarian polyamorous loving two partners equally without 
                            hierarchy. Depending on my flowing gender, I'm most often demisexual and panromantic. 
                            I am so many things.
                            <br/><br/>
                            If you see me around, feel free to stop me and say hi. That's at either at the UofA 
                            Chess Club, at the UofA Observatory, in The Shack, or around campus, anywhere really. 
                            I'm friendly and I don't bite. I love boardgames and programming and sci-fi, especially 
                            the old sci-fi classics(Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and Babylon 5 to name a few).
                            <br/><br/>
                            Anyways, I joined a couple years ago, just as one generation of execs were getting old 
                            and graduating. When April rolled around there was only 3 of us undergrads who qualified 
                            for exec roles, and only I was willing to handle the President Captain's responsibilities. 
                            I was really eager to be a part of something and make a difference.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Honestly, I wasn't ready to be Captain. My first year, I dropped the membership fee, didn't 
                            attend clubs fair, and didn't put up posters. I had a ton of fun introducing our group to 
                            D&amp;D, but overall our club membership declined. History shows my first year hit an all-time 
                            high for club membership in January, but I think that was a little luck plus a lot of D&amp;D.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I've been working hard to enlarge the club and honor my predeccessors. This club has been running 
                            since the 80s and I want it to keep running for decades to come. I want to bring back SCi-Fi 
                            movie nights. I want to bring back book club. I've gotten serious about advertising for the club 
                            and running our events. History will probably remember me for running D&amp;D.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I recently retired from being Captain/President. I'm still really active in the club. I'm really 
                            proud of breaking the all-time record for club membership again, this time due to exceptional 
                            collaboration with other clubs. I think we were at 37 active members!? I'm really proud on my successor, 
                            Ana! I bet we'll never get a president better than her.

                            The Federation was handed a bitter pill to swallow recently, when Admiral Malmot, one of Starfleet's 
                            most distinguished officers, announced that he was actually a RomuLam double agent. The announcement 
                            put to rest the long months of specualtion concerning the supposedly Vulcan's mysterious disappearance 
                            during a routine survey mission on Hrconus III.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Malmot, now a praetor of the Star Empire, served a long, fruitful career in Starfleet, including full 
                            tours of duty as second officer aboard the U.S.S. Incontinent, and as the captain of the U.S.S. Inconceivable. 
                            The RomuLam agent occasionally appears in the Sol Univas B system to harass Captain Robert Leddy and 
                            the crew of SubSpace 6-20. Captain Leddy believes these visitations underlie Malmot's resentment toward 
                            the station commander.
                            <br/><br/>
                            "It was pretty clear from the start that he couldn't tolerate taking orders from someone with no experience 
                            as a starship captain," commented Leddy, on the Inconceivable's reassignment to SubSpace 6-20. When asked 
                            about the repeated appearances of Malmot's ship, the Warbird Peregrine, Leddy speculated that "he probably 
                            does it just to play mind games with our command staff.

                            <strong>Background: </strong><br/>
                            After making the great trek to the Academy in the Univas Albertus system all the way from planet Northglenora in 
                            the Westmountus system (just across the Muddy Way/Northsask Nebula), Beth was very happy to be alive. After participating 
                            in Orientation for the Academy, she happened upon a “buspass” dealer, and purchased one of these handy items with the last 
                            block of gold-pressed latinum she possessed. With this, she was able to attain warp speed and travel all the way home 
                            in less than one quarter of a Terran hour. From then on, she never needed to walk again, and so grew fat and lazy and 
                            very fond of trans-fat laden foods.
                            <br/><br/>
                            After a time, however, her motorized wheelchair became quite uncomfortable, and she longed to find a newer, comfier chair 
                            to sit in. After much searching, she happened upon a strange little tribe that inhabited the far reaches of the sixth level 
                            of the SUB station. This little tribe loved to watch movies and TV shows all day long and do little else. Though Beth did 
                            find them to be a cute, cuddly and rather entertaining bunch, Beth found little else that was interesting about them. But 
                            just as she was about to depart to continue on her search, she noticed a grey chair sitting in the corner of the tribe’s quarters. 
                            Suddenly, her eyes lit up as she dashed towards the chair, and sat on it. Immediately her rear end felt more comfortable and 
                            more at-ease than it ever had before. But the little tribe saw all of this, and proceeded to tell their tribal leader, whose 
                            name was Ama Ndablunt. When Ama Ndablunt heard the news, her teeth began to grind, and she started to snort and growl with boiling 
                            rage, the likes of which none of her tribesmen had seen before. She then stormed out into the gathering room and rushed at Beth, 
                            her eyes ablaze and her claws outstretched, ready to gouge Beth’s eyes out with one fell swoop. You see, Beth had inadvertently 
                            sat in Ama Ndablunt’s special chair, and NO ONE was to sit in that chair except for Ama Ndablunt, or else they would invite her 
                            terrible wrath upon them. Somehow, Beth managed to spring out of Ama Ndablunt’s chair and back into her own motorized chair, 
                            just in time to speed away from Ama Ndablunt’s scratching claws and gnashing teeth. As Beth sped away with all the speed her 
                            trusty chair could muster, she heard the piercing, savage screams of Ama Ndablunt behind her, and Beth immediately regretted 
                            that she wasn’t able to sit in that comfy grey chair longer. Her butt was already growing sore again.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Many years later, as Beth was wandering aimlessly around the Academy campus, one of the tribesmen that she had seen years before 
                            came up to her. At first Beth was frightened, but the tribesman held his hand up as a sign of peace.
                            <br/><br/>
                            “I mean you no harm, O chair-dweller! I bring you good tidings! Our leader Ama Ndablunt has died, after running into a cement wall 
                            very fast and going into a coma. She was a brave leader, Ama Ndablunt, but alas, she grew quite insane in the last few years, and 
                            had become very savage and brutal to her subjects (we think it may have been all the many years she was forced to deal with the Es-Yu 
                            people and the Dekesians). This is why I have come to seek you out, O chair-dweller---we wish that you might become our new leader. 
                            You showed great courage that day when you fled the terrible wrath of Ama Ndablunt. Not one of us could have sprung out of that chair 
                            as you did! We would have surely frozen stiff with terror when faced with such awful savagery. So, great chair-dweller, will you lead 
                            us? Please say yes, so that I may not be forced to assume such great and awesome responsibility.” The tribesman later said his name was “Chris”.
                            <br/><br/>
                            As Beth came to grasp with this sudden request, she then remembered that comfortable grey chair.
                            <br/><br/>                            
                            “Ah!” she thought to herself. “At long last I finally get what I’ve always wanted: The comfy chair!” Of course, she immediately accepted 
                            Chris’ request, and became the tribe’s leader. To this day, she still sits there, drooling all over herself in complete comfort and 
                            relaxation. But the tribesmen (and tribeswomen) don’t care, so long as someone else can go slowly insane instead of one of them.
