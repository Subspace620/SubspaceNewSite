				The 620 SUB STORY: The Formative Years 1987-1992
			</h2>
			
			<div id="formative" class="retractable">
				<h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
					<p>
					Call me Ishmael. No, that's stupid, nobody is named Ishmael anymore. Nobody
					says, Let's go over to Ish's place and watch the game on TV. Besides, my name is
					Jeff. Call me Jeff. I had to ask around, as the U of A Star Trek Club (UASTC)was
					formed before I joined. I'll try to be as objective as possible about telling
					the story of the early years of the club, and I won't make any more allusions to
					Moby Dick. Well, just one more: we definitely had a Great White Whale in the
					club, but I will leave it up to your imagination as to which member that was.
					</p>

				<h4>THE VERY BEGINNING:</h4>
					<p>
					According to Tara Shortt (not at all whale-like), the UASTC started in 1987,
					maybe about six months before I moved to Edmonton. This club called themselves
					the USS Bonaventure, which I think maybe was based on the typical
					Constitution-class starship that Trekkies are familiar with.
					</p>
					<p>
					I came from UBC,
					where halfway through my Psych degree, I ran out of money, and the cost of
					living was too high. I moved to Alberta becuase there was more work, and I could
					live more cheaply and still go to school. At UBC, I was a member of the UBC
					Science Fiction Society, which I imagine is something like your present club. It
					was very, very relaxed, though, and also very literary. Perhaps our most
					illustrious member was William Gibson, who was getting ready to publish his
					"Burning Chrome" collection about the time that I started to run out of money,
					which made me likely the least illustious member. I remember Bill's funky early
					Mac laptop, which I instantly hated.
					</p>
					<p>
					Moving to U of A, I expected to find a
					similar group, but instead the Bonaventure was very strictly Star Trek, and also
					strict about rules and regulations, as well as being very fond of wearing their
					uniforms and props in public. Oh, well, I figured, SF is SF. Some Bonaventures
					were well-read in SF, others could recite the entire Star Trek canon by memory.
					Most of them were nice folk, though.
					</p>
					<p>
					Bonaventure started out as a private club
					that happened to be mostly university students. They rented out space from a
					local library for their weekly meetings, but quickly found a better deal by
					renting out a classroom from the U of A. When they couldn't get together, they
					ran a computer BBS, also called The Bonaventure. A BBS (Bulletin Board System)
					was sort of a private dial-up Internet that existed before the Internet. Please
					see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system</a> for more information on
					BBS's in general.
					</p>
					<p>
					From what I recall, the Bonaventure club was run by Captain Howard Gibbons, and
					the BBS was run by SysOp Max ________, his friend. Although the Bonaventure club
					was mixed with university students and general public members, some of the
					younger university students tended to hang out together. According to the
					Bonaventure charter, they were allowed to form a "shuttlecraft" called
					Encounter.
					</p>

				<h4>THE ENCOUNTER</h4>
					<p>
					Encounter's first commander was, I believe, Joanne Wotypka. Joanne was very
					pretty, very bright, and most of all, very willing to go through all of the
					paperwork to start a proper U of A Club Charter. The Encounter thus became
					formally The U Of A Star Trek Club, and were awared the office at 620 SUB. The
					more casual university student members of the Bonaventure club migrated to this
					office, where I think we were provided with a desk and a couch. Joanne provided
					a bunk bed for extra room and sleep, and we decorated the place with the usual
					posters. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Early members were Joanne, Earl Woods, Tony Longworth, Ron Briscoe, Allan
					Sampson, Carrie Humprhies, Paul _______, Steven Neumann, Susan Neumann... maybe
					a few others I regret I may have forgotten. I joined a little later, followed by
					Jim Sandercock. 
					</p>
					<p>
					We were a very small club, with no real chance of growth. Our big marketing
					scheme was a weekly ad that ran in the Gateway for free for years: "WANNA SEE
					SPOCK SOCK ON A LOLLIPOP? COME TO 620 SUB, U OF A STAR TREK CLUB". That line was
					witten by Steven Neumann, based on a large black and white photo of Leonard
					Nimoy in costume eating candy. If you still have that photo, I would consider it
					a personal favour if it were to be destroyed. Nobody paid attention to that ad
					but me. Nobody saw the spelling error. It was many months before I realised that
					we could change the ad, at which point it became something like, "FEELING LONELY
					AND DEPRESSED AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? SAME HERE. 620 SUB STAR TREK
					CLUB." That at least got some response from a group of neurotic girls who were
					very nice but not at all into SF. After that, we made the effort to be better
					club recruiters.
					</p>
					<p>
					However, the University itself added to our number. Our lonely little club was
					paired up with an even smaller club, The U of A Scuba Club, led by the vivacious
					Andrea Macleod. The scuba people were definitely not Trekkies, but they were
					very friendly and accomodating, especially now that they had a window view
					instead of a corner of the cellar in SUB. 
					</p>

				<h4>EARL J. WOODS</h4>
					<p>
					After some time, Joanne became too busy to run the club. We held an election and
					appointed Earl Woods as the new leader. You list him as being "brash" in your
					website, but really, that would be that very last word to describe Earl. I can
					describe for you "The Woods Manoeuvre", which appeared in a short story. In a
					fictional battle with a superior starship, Captain Woods turned the belly of his
					ship to the enemy and jettisoned the covers to the warp core. A single phaser
					blast would ignite the antimatter and blast both ships into bits a thousand
					times smaller than tribble farts. Then, Woods invited the enemy commander over
					for a luxurious dinner, where he carefully explained at length the Federation
					position and negotiated an acceptable compromise. That's the Woods Manoeuvre,
					and as brash as Earl ever got.
					</p>
					<p>
					Earl was a poli-sci major and both a Big L and small l liberal, in every sense
					of the word. He was (and is now) devoted to the Alberta Liberal Party as well as
					the liberal nature of the Star Trek Federation. Being a poli-sci major, he
					yearned for the opportunity to prove himself a leader, so who were we to stand
					in his way?
					</p>
					<p>
					At the time, Ron Briscoe ran a BBS he called Freedom, in direct opposition to
					the rules-intensive Bonaventure. Freedom was not strictly a Star Trek BBS, but
					there was a lot of content based on Trek and other SF. Earl used Freedom as his
					sounding board by writing a huge volume of Star Trek-based short stories that
					took place on the USS Encounter. The Encounter was one of those
					alternate-reality stories that featured all of the UASTC members as characters,
					for better or worse. 
					</p>
					<p>
					It was here that Encounter made an unofficial transition from shuttlecraft to
					ship (Reliant-class), but not by following any Star Trek Club charter rules,
					which if I remember, actually pee'd off the Bonaventure. So, I guess the
					Encounter was the first "ship" for the UASTC, and Earl promoted himself from
					Lieutenant to Captain. Again, we couldn't argue, he was such a believer. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Please click here to see a recent "re-imagining" of Lieutenant Woods, based on the recent Star Trek movie:
					<a href="http://shyluk.blogspot.com/2010/04/100-lieutenant-earl.html">http://shyluk.blogspot.com/2010/04/100-lieutenant-earl.html</a>
					</p>

				<h4>TONY LONGWORTH</h4>
					<p>
					If I had to describe Tony, I would call him "the life of the party". Earl was
					friendly but reserved, while Tony was bombastic and outgoing. At one point, Tony
					wanted the UASTC to be more involved with outside projects which were usually
					beyond Earl's stodgy zone of comfort and our collective budget. In 1991 or 1992,
					the UASTC and the Scuba people rented a van for a memorable trip to Los Angeles.
					</p>
					<p>
					Tony decided to form his own organization, called the USS Hully-Gully, which was
					sort of a sly protest club devoted more to fun stuff and less to sitting around
					computers. However, Tony's respect of Earl was so high that he made Earl the
					honorary co-Captain. The Hully-Gully really existed only as a name and as
					entries in the Freedom BBS. It was too much paperwork to actually form a new
					Star Trek organization at the U of A. 
					</p>
					<p>
					The UASTC also formed alliances with another misfit club called the M.O.O.S.E
					Club (run by "Mustafa Al-Habib", pen name), whose primary purpose was to
					generate the evocative "Space Moose" cartoon strip as well as keep an arcade
					game of Space Frenzy set at the most insanely difficult level at all times. The
					M.O.O.S.E. people sometimes provided some interesting diversions.
					</p>

				<h4>JIM SANDERCOCK</h4>
					<p>
					I was graduating by the time the younger club members were establishing
					themselves. From what I recall, Jim Sandercock, looking almost exactly like the
					Salvatorian version of Jesus Christ (minus the holy wounds, but plus wire-rimmed
					glasses), took over the UASTC when Earl & I graduated. I lost track of what
					happened to the club after that, which would be 1992. Jim I remember as being an
					intermediate between Earl and Tony, and so would have been a good choice to run
					the club. I also recall that another Jeff joined up, mostly to replace me.

				Subspace 620: Rebuilding and Regrouping (Circa 2010)
			</h2>
			
			<div id="regrouping" class="retractable">
				<p>
				Hello, my name is Joel and let me tell you a story. This is the story of
				Subspace 620 during my time as member of the club with special emphasis on
				the 2009-2010 year that I was Club president. I hope you find it informative
				and interesting. Thank you for your time and do enjoy....
				</p>
				<p>
				When I joined Subspace 6-20, in the fall of 2007, the mailing list was abuzz
				with discussion. There were many events in the planning at most times and my
				email account was getting swamped with emails. I was able to make it to a
				few events the first term, in particular the fun start of year barbeque in
				Emily Murphy Park and the great Halloween Party at Josh's apartment's Party
				Room) but by christmas I was getting so many emails it was overwhelming so I
				stopped reading a bunch of them, instead focussing more on school work. Now
				by the time the winter term was well underway I had decided to get back into
				the action and made it to a few more events, culminating in my Election to
				the position of Extended-Executive at the end of year elections.
				</p>
				<p>
				As is often the case, the summer was much quieter and before I knew it I was
				helping out at clubs fair, trying to sign up new members. During my second
				year in the club, and first on the executive, I made a serious attempt to
				attend more events and even get more people coming to some events. This was
				also the year that I was handed responsibility for the club's website. The
				website had not been given a full overhaul in a while and I set my sights on
				bringing it up to speed with more current club status and also keeping it up
				to date as much as possible. This task proved to be more work than
				originally expected and by the year's end I had only managed a minor update
				of the inner workings of the website, bringing the pages more in sync with
				each-other but no large scale overhaul.
				</p>
				<p>
				This brings us to the elections that had me being elected club president. As
				part of my platform I promised to clean up the club office and make the
				club's closet/ex-bathroom a full and useful part of the club office. Also I
				had made clear my intention to update the constitution as well as continue
				the upgrading of the Club Website.
				</p>
				<p>
				Once classes ended the first of these challenges kicked off. After being
				refused assistance with making the closet/bathroom more useable from Student
				Group Services we settled for doing it all ourself. The first step was,
				naturally, cleaning out the closet and tossing out all the garbage that was
				in it (as well as returning some items to our past office-mates. This was
				eventually followed on with the building of a new raised-floor, yes that
				wood floor in the mini-sub-office is Subspace 620 property (Should the club
				ever be evicted it should be removed and kept by the club), and the search
				for a new, smaller desk for the sub-office was kicked off.
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition to the desk, a new couch was sought after and eventually one was
				donated via the future president of the club, James McNeice, by his
				landlord. This was accompanied by a set of wooden shelves and a microwave
				that went to <a href=Óhttp://uacs.caÓ>UACS (Undergraduate Association of
				Computing Science)</a>. Not long afterwards a new desk was purchased (The
				smaller one in the mini-sub-office) by Subspace 6-20 and the old, larger one
				was returned to Student Group Services. While it would be another few months
				before the floor would be finished and all the furniture put in place the
				club office was well on its way to being made far nicer and more useable.
				</p>
				<p>
				This brings me to my first promise I made in my election platform, the
				constitutional reform. Mostly the changes made to the constitution were to
				bring the constitution up to date with what the club's then current
				practices were. This included replacing mention of phone lists with mailing
				lists, creation of an appointed position of webmaster and updating the club
				name to officially include 'Fantasy', among a few others. The largest change
				that was proposed (And later accepted) was the possibility of running online
				elections. Prior to this all elections were mandated to be held in person.
				Considering the minuscule turnout we tended to get at the election event it
				was decided that online elections would be better for the club by allowing
				more members to vote and by having an more extended voting period. In a bit
				of Tautological twist, the Constitutional Amendment was itself ran as a
				online election, meaning that had the online election motion failed the
				whole amendment could have failed. Fortunately this part of the amendment
				passed with flying colours as did all other motions aside from one. The only
				motion to fail was the one to limit the mandatory minimum number of official
				executive meetings to once a term instead of twice a term.
				</p>
				<p>
				The next most memorable event during my presidency was the bank account....
				</p>
				<p>
				Now Subspace 6-20 had had a bank account since 1993-4 (Back when we were
				still the Star trek Club). This account had had signing authority passed on
				until 1998-9. The executive from that year, I was told by an executive from
				the following year (Fleet Admiral Amanda), did not pass the signing
				authority on when they graduated. Now this was not seen to be too big of a
				problem as the club still had the Debit card and knew its pin, meaning we
				could still make withdrawals and deposits. Business continued mostly as
				usual until after Amanda graduated. At this point some confusion arose that
				the signing authority was still held and could still be passed on, though at
				no time here was the bank informed of any of these transfers. So It came to
				my presidency that we got a notice from the bank that due to inactivity the
				account was now locked. After trying to unlock it and being told about the
				signing authority problem attempts were made to contact members of the
				1998-9 executive. As those were not successful the bank account was
				essentially abandoned and a new one has since been opened (With real
				transfers of signing authority promised to occur this time).
				</p>
				<p>
				Finally we come to the issue that had started to crop up during my year as
				Extended-Executive. The problem was that of dwindling attendance and
				dwindling use of the mailing list to organize events. The latter issue was
				at first attempted to be resolved by, in the winter term 2010, establishing
				a weekly movie night in the office (Which has since been continued by
				Presidents James and Jared in the CSC Common Area to much success). While
				this did not really grow the membership, a change that occurred shortly
				after I stepped down as president to go on an internship did give a large
				boost to membership.
				</p>
				<p>
				This change, that saved the club from dwindling out of existence, was
				switching to Google Groups from Yahoo Groups. The reason why this was
				effective was that Google Groups allowed, at the time, for the adding of
				members and requiring them to act to be removed as opposed to inviting and
				needing them to act to be added. This is important because it means that by
				default, anyone who signed up at Clubs Fair is automatically on the mailing
				list without needing to take affirmative action. This means that even if the
				person is swamped in the first few weeks with new emails or misses the
				invite email they are still on the mailing list and can learn about and come
				to events. For this very reason, one year later, when Google removed the
				'add to list' feature Subspace 6-20 move to Groupspaces (Who still had the
				'add' feature). This move again allowed the club to maintain high mailing
				list membership, thereby resulting in many more people hearing about events
				and as a result coming to events.
				</p>
				<p>
				Now it is April in my final year of University and I am about to pass off
				responsibility for this website to a new club member so I bid you all Adieu
				and wish you all the best of luck in the future!

				Subspace 620: Restarting as a Fantasy Club(2017-2018)

			<div id="restarting" class="retractable">
				<p>
					At the end of April of 2017 we were barely a club. We were lucky to have 
					the few undergraduates neccesary to fill all the executive roles and stay
					official. Over the summer the new president rediscovered D&D and decided
					to make it happen through the club. He thought that D&D was a game that
					might be something we played at boardgames night, but the roleplaying made
					it much more. What happened quadrupled if not quintupled the number of members 
					in the club, and revived Subspace 620. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The first boardgames night of the year was supposed to feature D&D as 
					something happening on the side. A few players would get together, choose
					characters, adventure in an imaginary world, kill monsters, talk to people,
					eventually saving a town from the oppression of an empire and becoming heroes.
					There was more than just a few though. Almost everyone who came for games
					was interested. Some members brought their friends, and others showed up who 
					had never come to a games night but wanted to play D&D. Too many people!
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to some help from an experienced D&D player and willingness of the
					boardgame players to join in, it turned out to be two simultaneous D&D 
					sessions with 5 or 6 players each. It was a huge success, and afterwards
					weekly Wednesday D&D sessions begun, game-mastered by the club president.
					Later a Monday D&D group began as well. Friday boardgame nights kept 
					happening, as usual, although only a few new players joined. Meanwhile new 
					friendships and a new kind of fun was had in the D&D groups. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Through December and January attempts were made to get more people involved 
					in the D&D campaigns. The results in the Wednesday group were inconsistent
					at first and then catastrophic when too many people were added at once. 
					The same feeling of adventure and magic that held the group together was
					lost and the D&D campaign came to a painful end. In the hopes of learning
					what went wrong and to become a better Gamemaster the club president started
					a new, large, D&D group on Mondays. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Advertising on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/">Reddit</a> for new players had surprising results. He was hoping for
					maybe enough players to start a new group, but there was enough people 
					interested to start 4 new separate D&D groups. The first session where everyone
					made characters went smoothly, despite there being 17 people all together. 
					Seventeen People! Last time this many club members were all together the year 
					was 2013 and we still did a traditional yearly Christmas gift swap. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In February there was 4 groups: A new Monday night D&D group, a new Tuesday
					Night D&D group, a tuesday afternoon D&D group that used to play on Mondays,
					and a Wednesday group playing a new campaign gamemastered by someone who joined
					in December. For the first time, the club president wasn't GMing all of the 
					D&D games and for the first time became a player. We peaked at 28 active club
					members! It's not certain whether the club has ever been this large.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now as we reach the end of April, the adventures of the groups formed in January
					have come to a close. Monday and Tuesday groups have defeated a powerful Spririt 
					Naga and a new chapter is beginning the for "The Orlane Outlaws" who play on
					Mondays. New tuesday group is changing into a new flexible drop-in, drop-out 
					format known as a West Marches Campaign. The old Tuesday group has advanced 
					and begun commanding armies, dabbling in politics, and will keep playing Tuesdays
					indefinitely. Wednesday group will likely continue.
