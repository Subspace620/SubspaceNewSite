                            To all whom it may concern: the current holder (henceforth referred to as "the 
                            individual") of this position was found to be a person of interest to the Board 
                            of Acquisitions, suspected of breaching nanite expulsion laws enacted by the CEO 
                            of Planet Terra, space subregion 620. A transcript, provided below, of this person's 
                            record is to be made available to any law enforcer of security clearance grade C 
                            or higher within the government or corporate structure.

                            Preliminary analysis of contacts known to the individual suggests a willingness to 
                            help maintain organisations they believe encourage or foster community dynamics, at 
                            the expense of their internalised fears. This has been further verified through their 
                            involvement in many different organisations and para-social gatherings. The status 
                            of this individual's current position, while not in violation of virus standards set 
                            by the CEO's word, do currently suggest a temporary nature, or one that remains 
                            ultimately unknown.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Further information regarding the individual is to be reported to the Captain or 
                            administration with utmost haste. The individual is not considered a threat to public 
                            control, and may further be useful for the continued application of the status-quo.

                            What’s up, fellow club members. It is I, the great SEAN MORAN, here to light up your 
                            days with my awkwardness! Around the club room, I’m known as the Video Gamer (unless 
                            Peter’s around, the darn title thief!). You can usually find me playing Red Dragon Inn 
                            if we’re in person, or Minecraft online on a number of servers.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Usually, if you see me around Campus, it’s either because I’m rushing to class or goofing 
                            off. I like to get involved with volunteer work, and even have an award for it! But mostly,
                            I’m known for my cheery attitude and my friendly, if awkward, attempts to socialise with 
                            the people around me. I’m not known for my social skills, but I like to think that I make 
                            up for it with my cheerful attitude and willingness to try almost anything. No drugs though!
                            <br/><br/>
                            I joined the club within my first week at the university. I was lost on campus during WOW, 
                            looking for anything related to D&amp;D, since I had just started playing it during my last year 
                            of high school and everyone in my group went to different universities. I actually got 
                            involved by running into Henry, our previous treasurer. No joke, I wasn’t paying attention 
                            and we ran into each other! He heard I was looking for D&amp;D, and practically dragged me to 
                            the club table. That’s where I met Melissa and Lauren, and discovered that Lauren is MUCH 
                            better at chess than I was.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Somehow, even though I only had one campaign experience in D&amp;D, I ended up as a DM to 
                            brand new players. It was an interesting experience, to say the least… The party ended up 
                            with a total wipe to a dragon. Then, I joined Josh’s campaign, where I also met Destiny, 
                            two of our other execs. I actually met Nic at the UofA Pokemon Club, believe it or not. 
                            It wasn’t until months after we met that we realized we were both in Subspace as well.
                            <br/><br/>
                            When elections came around, I was looking to get more involved with at least one of the clubs 
                            I was in. Since there were so few runners for the club elections, I kinda jumped on the wagon 
                            to be part of the bigger picture. I was all excited to do something… and then COVID struck. 
                            It’s been chaotic since, and we’re figuring out how to run the club virtually, but it hasn’t 
                            been perfect. Frankly, Subspace has become something of a family to me, to escape from the 
                            chaos that is my actual family and have somewhere else to go without thinking of the pandemic.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I don’t think any of us were ready for what 2020 brought us, and frankly, I think that it’s 
                            gonna be chaotic for a while, but I hope you will stay on this journey with us until the end 
                            of the line. Our journey? To boldly go where no club has gone before.

                            When choosing your name it is associated to your identity. Fatum translated to Fate in English. 
                            Fate translated to Destin in French. Destin translated to Destiny. This seemed close enough to 
                            her given title. Needing to be inconspicuous still, she chose her last name as Ducommun for its 
                            translate in French being “of the common.”
                            <br/><br/>
                            With a name chosen for herself, Destiny made her approach to the humans at the university of 
                            Alberta. Her mission was to blend in, study their ways, and learn their quirks. Her study of 
                            humans outright was to obvious, so she chose Biology and Mathematics as her subject fields. 
                            Biology for her studies, and math because numbers just make sense.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Destiny found subspace for the D&amp;D. It fascinated her how humans could disassociate into 
                            their fictional characters. This became an amusing way of venting and practicing her new forms 
                            expression. She committed to helping the club through the trials titled antifreeze before 
                            committing to being fully involved with the club. Destiny became so enamoured with club life 
                            she decided she wanted to help run it as well.
                            <br/><br/>
                            If by some chance you see Destiny in the wild feel free to approach her. She accepts food bribes 
                            and deep insightful conversation. A warning to all before approaching her though, where she goes 
                            chaos seems to follow. While she is not the harbinger of this herself, she recognizes the amusement 
                            and insanity factors in cultivating chaos.

                            Hi there, I'm Joshua. I joined the club here back in Fall of 2019 upon my third year of my degree 
                            and first year transferring. I joined the club in hopes of finding a D&amp;D game to join and make friends. 
                            Having made a lot of great friends I offered to help out with organizing the club and thus was asked 
                            to take on the position of a Lieutenant. This club means a lot to me, introducing me to a lot of my friends. 
                            I like to help out with the club as if gives me an opportunity to meet up with friends and give back to 
                            the club.

                            <br/><br/>
                            "Colleen" is a young human wizard who can be encountered by the players in the basement museums of the 
                            U of A's Earth Science Building (see dungeon map 12, page 57) during any quest that takes them there. 
                            She is friendly, if bumbling, and perpetually covered in ink from working in her spellbook. She has 
                            been a member of the adventurers' guild 'Subspace 620' since 2019. Immediately upon encountering the 
                            party, she will offer to identify any rocks they may have in their inventory.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Colleen can be convinced to act as a guide for the party through the rest of the EAS dungeon with a 
                            DC 13 persuasion check, and will further accompany them into the CCIS, Chemistry or Biosci dungeons 
                            with a DC 15 roll. Add a +5 bonus to the roll if the players have given her a rock to identify, or if 
                            they have previously completed the 'RPGs with Subspace 620' sidequest.
                            <br/><br/>
